With even higher expectations for 420 in 2024, smoke shop owners must be well-prepared to make the most of this popular time.
  
To truly capitalize on 420 as a smoke shop owner, it's not enough to simply match the offers of other cannabis retailers. Smoke shop owners should aim to surpass them in marketing coverage, in-store experience, and preparation.

Flower remained the most popular product category, accounting for 54% of total sales. However, cannabis concentrates experienced significant growth, with a 177% increase compared to the previous four Thursdays. Online orders also saw a rise, with a 10% increase compared to 2022.

Convenience in payment methods will be in high demand, with debit cards and ACH payments expected to play a larger role. Additionally, the adoption of order ahead and delivery services will continue to grow, providing customers with more convenient options.

To make the most of 420 as a smoke shop owner, it is essential to start planning early. Analyzing historical data can help determine popular products, traffic patterns, total sales, discount success, and marketing ROI. Setting clear goals, creating a budget, and developing a pricing and promotional strategy will provide direction.

Segmentation allows for personalized offers based on customer demographics and preferences. Launching a cross-channel marketing campaign through email, text messaging, website, social media, and loyalty programs can reach a wider audience. Optimizing store workflows, ensuring adequate staffing and training, and building redundancy into operations are crucial for a smooth 420 experience. Collecting and analyzing data on key metrics can provide insights for future campaigns and help manage inventory effectively.

In conclusion, with careful planning and execution, 420 can be a defining success for smoke shop owners, providing an excellent additional revenue stream.

FACTS - STATS - TRENDS (DOC #2) -- OTO - One-time offer?

Now, let's shift our focus to some intriguing growth facts about the cannabis industry in 2024. The cannabis industry is a dynamic field, with regulations, laws, sentiment, technology, and business practices evolving each year. In this report, we will explore the most important and relevant marijuana statistics for 2024, providing insights into marijuana use, acceptance, market opportunity, market trends, employment demand, and legal updates.

According to Gallup, half of Americans say they have tried marijuana at some point in their lives, which is a record high. Additionally, approximately one in six Americans say they use marijuana, also a new high for Gallup. These statistics indicate the growing acceptance and prevalence of marijuana use in society.

A recent study conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of MedMen found that over one-third of American women aged 21 and above consume cannabis. The study also revealed that women primarily use cannabis for therapeutic reasons, such as relieving anxiety, aiding sleep, and alleviating pain. Interestingly, many female cannabis consumers keep their cannabis use private, with 65% of women saying that there are people in their lives who are unaware of their cannabis use.

The majority of Americans now live in a state where cannabis is legalized, with 54% living in a state where recreational use is legal and 74% living in a state where cannabis is legal for either recreational or medical use. Furthermore, 79% of Americans live in a county with at least one cannabis dispensary, highlighting the widespread availability and accessibility of cannabis products.

Pre-rolls, which are pre-rolled cannabis joints, have gained popularity in the US. They are now the third-largest product category in the cannabis industry, following flower and vapor pens. Headset, a cannabis market research firm, found that pre-roll sales in the US increased by 13.4% compared to the previous year, outperforming other categories like edibles or concentrates. This growth in pre-roll sales indicates a shift in consumer preferences and the increasing demand for convenient and ready-to-use cannabis products.

When it comes to cannabis consumption methods, younger consumers, especially Generation Z and Millennials, prefer cannabis vape pens. These age groups account for 62.8% of all US cannabis sales and 70.8% of all vapor pen sales. This preference for vape pens among younger consumers can be attributed to their familiarity with nicotine vaporizers and the convenience of vaporizing cannabis.
  
A recent survey by CivicScience found that 21% of people participating in Dry January, a trend where individuals abstain from alcohol for the month, are replacing alcohol with cannabis and CBD. This indicates a growing trend of younger individuals turning away from alcohol and using cannabis as an alternative.

In terms of marijuana acceptance, 24 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam have legalized recreational cannabis use for individuals aged 21 and above. Additionally, medical use of marijuana is now legal in 40 states plus Washington D.C. These legalizations reflect the changing attitudes towards cannabis and the increasing recognition of its potential medical benefits.
Support for legalizing cannabis has reached a record high, with seven in ten Americans in favor of legalization, according to a Gallup poll. This marks a significant increase from the 12% of Americans who were in favor of legal cannabis when Gallup first gathered this data in 1969. The growing support for legalization indicates the shifting public opinion towards cannabis and the recognition of its potential economic and social benefits.

A recent study published in Clinical Therapeutics found that 91% of military veterans who use medical cannabis reported that it improved their quality of life. The study also found that medicinal cannabis can potentially play a harm-reduction role, helping veterans use fewer pharmaceutical medications and other substances.

Cannabis is also generating higher tax revenue than alcohol in several states. The Tax Foundation found that in the first quarter of 2023, 10 states generated more revenue from cannabis than from either alcohol or tobacco. This highlights the potential economic benefits of cannabis legalization and the tax revenue it can generate for states.

However, competitive pricing trends among cannabis brands and retailers have led to significant price declines in the industry since 2021. BDSA Retail Sales Tracking found that average retail cannabis prices dropped by 32% from their peak in Q3 2021 to Q2 2023. This price decline, combined with inflation, has made the industry even more competitive. As a result, cannabis brands have had to consolidate and find ways to differentiate themselves in a crowded market.  

As far as market opportunity, the US cannabis industry is projected to reach almost $40 billion in revenue in 2024, according to Statista. This indicates the significant economic growth potential of the cannabis industry and its contribution to the overall economy.  
  
In terms of market trends, cashless payments have been shown to improve dispensary performance. Data from Flowhub found that dispensaries accepting debit cards earned an average of $4,627 more per day than cash-only retailers. These dispensaries also processed 59% more transactions compared to cash-only dispensaries, and transactions paid with a debit card were $13 higher on average than cash-only transactions. This highlights the increasing demand for convenience and the preference for card payments among cannabis consumers. As a result, the adoption of debit payments is expected to continue to grow throughout 2024.

Millennials capture nearly half of every dollar spent on cannabis in the United States. According to Headset's Demographics Report, the millennial age group is the largest demographic of cannabis consumers, accounting for 46.2% of every dollar spent on weed. However, Gen Z is the fastest-growing group of marijuana users, with their percentage share of total cannabis sales growing by 11.3% year-over-year. This indicates a shift in market dynamics as younger generations become increasingly important consumers in the cannabis industry.  
  
The cannabis industry is also witnessing a realignment in terms of mergers and acquisitions. Instead of blockbuster acquisitions and rapid multi-state expansion, small and midsize businesses (SMBs) are now the focus of most M&A activity. This can be attributed to the contractions and corrections in the industry following its early explosive success. Savvy businesses are looking for mutually beneficial partnerships to maintain a foothold in the market and ride out the current correction. This trend of smaller businesses merging for survival or to thrive in challenging conditions is likely to continue in 2024.  
  
In conclusion, the cannabis industry is poised for significant growth and transformation in 2024. With increasing acceptance, market opportunities, and potential legal reforms, the industry presents numerous opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors. However, staying informed about evolving regulations, market trends, and consumer preferences is crucial to thrive in this dynamic landscape. By capitalizing on the latest data and insights, businesses can position themselves to succeed in the rapidly expanding cannabis market.
