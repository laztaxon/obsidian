- Hey team, I was wrapping up some projects in the ERP and I just wanted to make sure that we are emailing the stakeholders when projects are completed. The milestone for sending that email and filing it is the proof approval. The following projects should have an email sent to the stakeholders:  
	1. Retail bag Stickers
	2. Single Serve Orange Gummies
