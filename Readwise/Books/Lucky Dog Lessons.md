## Highlights
- Our goal is to build a bond and teach basic obedience. And we want our dogs to do those things out of love, not fear. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=787))
- Be Calm. ([Location 839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=839))
- Before you can begin to teach commands or solve issues, you have to learn the art of patience. ([Location 856](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=856))
- As a bonus, waiting for a dog to come to you is a very subtle way of getting him to begin to see you as a leader. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=865))
- When we’re dealing with dogs, we need to acknowledge their species’ instincts: they want to be part of a pack, they need to know where they stand in the family, they have strong drives for food and for whatever specific jobs they were bred to do. ([Location 886](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=886))
- Be Consistent. ([Location 895](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=895))
- When you’re building trust with a puppy, a rescue, or a shy or fearful dog, one of the most important things you can do is continually demonstrate that you are a consistent, predictable person. ([Location 899](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=899))
- For rescues, it’s amazing how just learning that food will be pinging into a dish twice a day can start to put them at ease. Other predictable elements of a schedule—like a walk time and regular opportunities to get outside for a few minutes—will all help your dog feel he knows what to expect. ([Location 902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=902))
- If your dog is afraid of something, show him you care and reassure him in a calm, low tone. ([Location 907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=907))
- A true bond with someone betters their chances of consistently eating, drinking water, being tended to when they’re sick or cold or lonely, and, most importantly, being loved. ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=915))
- Exercise. This one’s a win-win. Exercising with your dog is an easy way to build the bond between you. If walking is your thing, that’s great for both of you. Make it more interesting by changing your route or your pace. ([Location 921](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=921))
- What matters here is that if you take the time to play, your dog will quickly learn to associate time spent with you with the joyful feeling of a favorite toy or game. ([Location 941](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=941))
- You can create a great social experience for your dog by arranging a puppy play date, visiting a dog park, or having a friend visit and bring treats. ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=949))
- Instead of diving into training, I spent time with him. I sat beside him, petted him, gave him treats, spoke in a reassuring voice, and let him get to know me. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=975))
- 1.  Mental preparation       2.  Control       3.  Focus       4.  Technique       5.  Tools       6.  Conditioning ([Location 1035](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=1035))
- It’s your mental game that will set the tone for how your dog-training time is going to flow; it’s your mental strength that will get you through the moments when it seems like nothing you’re teaching is sinking in. ([Location 1047](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=1047))
- “The face you show your dog is the face that’s shown back to you.” ([Location 1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=1050))
- You want to show the face of a boss, not an employee; a teacher, not a student. This is not an angry or aggressive face. Instead, it’s one that doesn’t show frustration or doubt or hesitation. ([Location 1051](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=1051))
- At other times, you can show your dog the face of a playmate or a pal, but during training, position yourself as the wise teacher. ([Location 1057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=1057))
- As you delve into the training techniques in this book, remember that you need to be a confident, secure, and understanding leader for your dog. ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=1066))
- No matter how you feel inside, your face should say, “We’re doing this. I’m not quitting, and I don’t want you to quit, either.” ([Location 1074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AFYCN3C&location=1074))
