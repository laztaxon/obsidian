## Highlights
- Fear plays an enormous role in the ways we get stuck living lives that are stale, stagnant, or downright miserable. It’s often what leads us down paths that feel safe but that, deep down, we know are wrong for us. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=151))

- More specifically, they are afraid to have what might show up inside of them—the thoughts, feelings, and sensations—were they to do something different. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=169))

- What ties the technical way of talking about fear with the more colloquial, casual way of talking, is that they both imply avoidance: staying away from things that are uncomfortable or unfamiliar. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=177))

- So what does it mean to stop avoiding and face your fears? In a nutshell, it means taking part in life as a full participant, whether that means fully engaging in the boring book your toddler wants you to read to her yet again (even though your work email is piling up) or wholly embracing the sadness that arises as you notice that she’s getting older and won’t always be the baby you love so much. It means facing stuff that sucks—boredom, sadness, whatever—and doing it anyway. This requires that you spend some time considering how you want to be in any moment, knowing that all you can control is your actions. You can’t control other people. You can’t force the world to fit into your mold. But you can decide what’s important to you and live that out. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=198))

- Even though you can dip into this book at any spot, do read the full introduction, because it will orient you to how we think about behavior, especially unnecessary avoidance and control, the heart of what can make life narrow, empty, and downright sucky.

- You do, you get. For example, in the following scenarios, what you get from avoiding stuff is in italics: When you stay home, you don’t have to worry about what folks will think of you at that party. When you feel anxious, you have a drink and feel less anxious. When you feel sad, you start scrolling on your phone, and sadness fades into the background. When you feel hurt or vulnerable, you yell at your spouse and feel a small release of the anger. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=236))

- The stuff you get is important—it determines, at least in part, whether you do the thing again or whether you stop. ([Location 243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=243))

- If avoiding the party reduces your anxiety, you are more likely to avoid in other ways—like not returning your friends’ calls, not answering those emailed invitations, and so on. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=245))
- everything you do makes sense. People don’t do stuff that doesn’t work. The tricky part is whether stuff works the way you think it does and whether it has other consequences. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=249))
- What tells you when, where, and how to avoid stuff? Something has to set the stage for all humans to avoid, for us to do—or not do—and subsequently get. ([Location 257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=257))

- Triggers can be anything at all—a feeling, a thought, a memory, an absence, a longing for something. We’ll use the same examples for this list and put the triggers in italics. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=259))

- Notice that most of these triggers involve something going on inside of you, like a thought or feeling, even if they arise in response to something going on outside of you. We are thinking and feeling organisms. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=268))
- Avoidance Is About Control ([Location 273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=273))

- You get to exert a measure of control over all of that uncomfortable stuff by staying away from the situations that might evoke it. But controlling, especially controlling through avoiding, doesn’t really work as well as we think it does. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=278))

- There’s a difference between controlling stuff outside of our heads (in the world) versus inside our heads. ([Location 296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=296))

- It’s not that we have no influence over what shows up inside of us. We’ve all had the experience of pushing away a thought or feeling for a moment in order to get things done. It’s just that trying to control the stuff that comes from your head and your heart is just not as reliably successful as we expect it to be. And the more intense or meaningful that stuff is—if it’s the anger you feel about getting laid off, the memory of a time when you felt intense shame, or the fear you feel about leaving a toxic relationship—the harder it is.

- The only problem is that what we perceive as threats are different from when we were living during the stone age. It’s that pesky inside-outside problem again. Unintended Consequences The problem is not just that control doesn’t work the way we hope it will. There are other consequences as well. The more we try to tighten our control, the less attention we can pay to other things outside in the world. The more we try to avoid, the stronger the need to avoid gets. And the smaller and smaller our lives become. ([Location 327](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B084JGHMRW&location=327))
