## Highlights
- “optimal stopping” ([Location 46](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=46))
- Committing to or forgoing a succession of options is a structure that appears in life again and again, in slightly different incarnations. ([Location 48](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=48))
- They don’t need a therapist; they need an algorithm. The therapist tells them to find the right, comfortable balance between impulsivity and overthinking. The algorithm tells them the balance is thirty-seven percent. ([Location 56](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=56))
- Because for people there’s always a time cost. It doesn’t come from the design of the experiment. It comes from people’s lives. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=511))
- “The theory of optimal stopping is concerned with the problem of choosing a time to take a given action,” opens the definitive textbook on optimal stopping, and it’s hard to think of a more concise description of the human condition. ([Location 517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=517))
- Hesitation—inaction—is just as irrevocable as action. What the motorist, locked on the one-way road, is to space, we are to the fourth dimension: we truly pass this way but once. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=525))
- Every day we are constantly forced to make decisions between options that differ in a very specific dimension: do we try new things or stick with our favorite ones? We intuitively understand that life is a balance between novelty and tradition, between the latest and the greatest, between taking risks and savoring what we know and love. ([Location 537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=537))
- Simply put, exploration is gathering information, and exploitation is using the information you have to get a known good result. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=552))
- explore/exploit tradeoff isn’t just a way to improve decisions about where to eat or what to listen to. It also provides fundamental insights into how our goals should change as we age, and why the most rational course of action isn’t always trying to choose the best. ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=581))
- When balancing favorite experiences and new ones, nothing matters as much as the interval over which we plan to enjoy them. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=595))
- A sobering property of trying new things is that the value of exploration, of finding a new favorite, can only go down over time, as the remaining opportunities to savor it dwindle. ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=602))
- Robbins specifically considered the case where there are exactly two slot machines, and proposed a solution called the Win-Stay, Lose-Shift algorithm: choose an arm at random, and keep pulling it as long as it keeps paying off. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=629))
- Exploration in itself has value, since trying new things increases our chances of finding the best. So taking the future into account, rather than focusing just on the present, drives us toward novelty. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=720))
- “To try and fail is at least to learn; to fail to try is to suffer the inestimable loss of what might have been.” ([Location 743](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=743))
- Following the advice of these algorithms, you should be excited to meet new people and try new things—to assume the best about them, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=793))
- To live in a restless world requires a certain restlessness in oneself. So long as things continue to change, you must never fully cease exploring. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=965))
- By the 1960s, one study estimated that more than a quarter of the computing resources of the world were being spent on sorting. And no wonder—sorting is essential to working with almost any kind of information. ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=1078))
- This is the first and most fundamental insight of sorting theory. Scale hurts. ([Location 1106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=1106))
- Computer science has developed a shorthand specifically for measuring algorithmic worst-case scenarios: it’s called “Big-O” notation. ([Location 1134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B015CKNWJI&location=1134))
