## Highlights
- Unlike arming people with guns or bombs, no one will die from being armed with the techniques of argument. Instead, real communication will be increased through greater awareness of the complexities and subtleties of argument. ([Location 106](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=106))
- By spotting weaknesses, mistakes, and falsehoods in your own and other people's arguments, you stand a much better chance of holding to and acting on true beliefs. The advantage to this approach is success; making decisions on false beliefs can only lead to error and trouble. ([Location 133](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=133))
- An argument is creative when the arguers are willing to explore a position in order to determine its value, when you and your partner are willing to alter or reconsider a position if strong arguments are brought against it. An attached argument is just the opposite: You or your partner have a strong commitment to a position, an emotional or psychological stake in seeing one conclusion triumph. ([Location 136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=136))
- Attachment to positions becomes a problem when there is a strong difference of opinion. Since attachment means that opposers are unwilling or unable to change their minds, they tend to become stubborn and uncooperative. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=139))
- When you know that your opposer is unreasonably attached to some belief, you should treat the argument differently. If your argument partner does not change his mind, you should not assume you have lost; in situations of attachment, nothing will change an opposer's mind. Arguing with a salesman about the value of a product, with a nationalist about the policies of her country, or a parent about the beauty of his child-all are arguments unlikely to end in agreement. ([Location 143](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=143))
- The essence of defensive argument is simple: Assume everyone is out to get you! ([Location 163](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=163))
- The less you believe, the less likely you are to believe something false. ([Location 165](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=165))
- The more suspicious you are, the less likely you are to be hoodwinked. ([Location 184](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=184))
- Positions are not true simply because we want them to be. Your attachment may prevent you from presenting good reasons for your position, and you will not be able to tolerate those reasons being probed. ([Location 205](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=205))
- By the time you've finished this book, you will find it easy, at the very least, to confuse people who are not on guard. Don't do it. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=213))
- If an argument is creative, then in one very important sense no one loses. A. creative argument involves people who have a belief, hunch, or idea about the truth, but who are also open to change. ([Location 225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=225))
- The key reason for using Super-Rule I is the desire to keep the investigation open. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=242))
- Not admitting defeat leaves open the possibility of continuing discussion.Haste means you might admit defeat too quickly, and then it will not be long before you change your mind back to your original position. The responsibility is on you to think of the replies you need, or to finally agree to change your mind, but you need the time and context in which to do this properly. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=251))
- This is a basic key to understanding argument: If the reasons are good and the logic is correct, you are bound to accept the claim. This is why you never attack claims directly. If Paul and Caroline are arguing about what sort of car to buy, there is no value in each of them just stating and restating claims. ([Location 280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=280))
- But arguers often hide their real reasons behind other, less embarrassing, reasons-a process called rationalization that shows how necessary the Principle of Rationality is. We always want to give reasons and, if we do not like the real reasons, we will make up others. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=310))
- Principle of Similar Cases: Where two cases or situations are similar, a reason must be offered for not treating them the same. ([Location 348](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=348))
- Always identify your opposer's principles. By looking at the positions and reasons you can figure out what the principle is. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=371))
- Whenever possible, embrace the consequences of your position.This means you are better off accepting the odd and unanticipated consequences rather than changing the principle. Arguing that examples are not similar or changing the rule can be dangerous-you might shift to a position you have not clearly thought out. If the example can be dismissed as different, there is no problem. But if not, try to hold onto the principle by accepting the example. ([Location 388](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=388))
- The only way to deal with a nonlistener is with patience and repetition.Even this last attempt may fail. But take solace: The true nonlistener suffers a lonely fate-no one wants to talk to him. ([Location 418](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=418))
- In argument you never use the conclusion to prove the premise-it's always the other way ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=502))
- When suddenly you no longer know what you are arguing about, check to see if the subject was changed. ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=585))
- Most arguers do not have the confidence to suppose that the other person has made a mistake or committed afallacy when it's so much easier to blame themselves: "There I go again, too stupid to know what's happening, too thick to follow the argument. Well, he's pretty bright, so I suppose he knows what he's talking about." Like hell! All you do with this attitude is compound a felony. First you forget to listen; then, when you come back and are confused you assume it is you, not your opposer, who is at fault. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=613))
- Sometimes you may not want to be subtle about getting the subject back on track. It might be to your advantage to let a respondent know in no uncertain terms that you areaware of the subject change, that you know very well what is going on. You might be dealing with a constant subject-switcher, a real ground-changer-most of whom (unless they are politicians) commit their fallacies unintentionally. Not only do they ignore your arguments and replies, but they do not even listen to their own. ([Location 631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=631))
- If your opposer says "Everyone knows . . . " -and you don't know-then your opposer is wrong. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=675))
- The popularity fallacy does not depend on your ignorance for its success, but on your fear of seeming ignorant. Not attacking the fallacy lets your opposer know that you are not only ignorant but gullible, so you are better off attacking. ([Location 681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=681))
- You must learn to feel pride in your ignorance. After all, you might be an accountant, or stock clerk, or homemaker, or whatever: It is not your job to know about RAM or megabytes, so why should you? Your very reason for going to an expert is because it is her job. So, the first half of the solution is to freely admit, even flaunt, your ignorance. This prevents premature agreement. ([Location 761](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=761))
- Our Hero has realized that the question is not how the dissidents are to be labeled, but how Polly is to respond to their arguments. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=808))
- Individuals are accused of saying or doing things that are racist or sexist because they disagree with someone's position. Opposing a program or a position that is popular with some group, however, does not mean that you are against that group; opposing it means you are not satisfied with the reasons for the position or program. Attacking opposers because they disagree with you, rather than attacking the reasons for a claim, is an example of the fallacy. ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=817))
- Force may end an argument-but the result will not endure. ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B000SARZCI&location=1123))
