## Highlights
- I loved and ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=69))
- hated my father for living on his own terms in a world that usually denies Black people their own ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=69))
- terms. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=69))
- Even now I wonder if it was my poor sense of self that first generated my poor sense of my people. Or was it my poor sense of my people that inflamed a poor sense of myself? ([Location 95](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=95))
- Had I forgotten that I—not “Black youth”—was the one who had confined his dreams to sports? And I was calling Black youth “they”? Who on earth did I think I was? ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=117))
- I did not realize that to say something is inferior about a racial group is to say a racist idea. I thought I was serving my people, when in fact I was serving up racist ideas about my people to my people. ([Location 121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=121))
- A racist culture had handed me the ammunition to shoot Black people, to shoot myself, and I took and used it. Internalized racism is the real Black on Black crime. ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=132))
- Denial is the heartbeat of racism, beating across ideologies, races, and nations. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=146))
- One either allows racial inequities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequities, as an antiracist. There is no in-between safe space of “not racist.” ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=154))
- the only way to undo racism is to consistently identify and describe it—and then dismantle it. The attempt to turn this usefully descriptive term into an almost unusable slur is, of course, designed to do the opposite: to freeze us into inaction. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=158))
- THE GOOD NEWS is that racist and antiracist are not fixed identities. We can be a racist one minute and an antiracist the next. What we say about race, what we do about race, in each moment, determines what—not who—we are. I used to be racist most of the time. I am changing. I am no longer identifying with racists by claiming to be “not racist.” I am no longer speaking through the mask of racial neutrality. I am no longer manipulated by racist ideas to see racial groups as problems. I no longer believe a Black person cannot be racist. ([Location 168](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=168))
- They stopped thinking about saving Black people and started thinking about liberating Black people. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=242))
- If we don’t do the basic work of defining the kind of people we want to be in language that is stable and consistent, we can’t work toward stable, consistent goals. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=262))
- To be an antiracist is to set lucid definitions of racism/antiracism, racist/antiracist policies, racist/antiracist ideas, racist/antiracist people. To be a racist is to constantly redefine racist in a way that exonerates one’s changing policies, ideas, and personhood. ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=264))
- There is no such thing as a nonracist or race-neutral policy. Every policy in every institution in every community in every nation is producing or sustaining either racial inequity or equity between racial groups. ([Location 276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=276))
- “Institutional racism” and “structural racism” and “systemic racism” are redundant. Racism itself is institutional, structural, and systemic. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=281))
- The most threatening racist movement is not the alt right’s unlikely drive for a White ethnostate but the regular American’s drive for a “race-neutral” one. The construct of race neutrality actually feeds White nationalist victimhood by positing the notion that any policy protecting or advancing non-White Americans toward equity is “reverse discrimination.” That is how racist power can call affirmative action policies that succeed in reducing racial inequities “race conscious” and standardized tests that produce racial inequities “race neutral.” That is how they can blame the behavior of entire racial groups for the inequities between different racial groups and still say their ideas are “not racist.” ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=300))
- A racist idea is any idea that suggests one racial group is inferior or superior to another racial group in any way. Racist ideas argue that the inferiorities and superiorities of racial groups explain racial inequities in society. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=307))
- An antiracist idea is any idea that suggests the racial groups are equals in all their apparent differences—that there is nothing right or wrong with any racial group. Antiracist ideas argue that racist policies are the cause of racial inequities. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=310))
- Racism is a powerful collection of racist policies that lead to racial inequity and are substantiated by racist ideas. Antiracism is a powerful collection of antiracist policies that lead to racial equity and are substantiated by antiracist ideas. ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=313))
- Racist voting policy has evolved from disenfranchising by Jim Crow voting laws to disenfranchising by mass incarceration and voter-ID laws. Sometimes these efforts are so blatant that they are struck down: North Carolina enacted one of these targeted voter-ID laws, but in July 2016 the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit struck it down, ruling that its various provisions “target African Americans with almost surgical precision.” ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D2364N5&location=341))
- Racist ideas have defined our society since its beginning and can feel so natural and obvious as to be banal, but antiracist ideas remain difficult to comprehend, in part because they go against the flow of this country’s history. As Audre Lorde said in 1980, “We have all been programmed to respond to the human differences between us with fear and loathing and to handle that difference in one of three ways: ignore it, and if that is not possible, copy it if we think it is dominant, or destroy it if we think it is subordinate. But we have no patterns for relating across our human differences as equals.” To be an antiracist is a radical choice in the face of this history, requiring a radical reorientation of our consciousness.
