## Highlights
- I should be used to this, but it still takes a piece out of me every time. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=213))
- I like Keisha. She isn’t afraid. And I’m afraid of so much. ([Location 216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=216))
- “Ally,” Mrs. Silver says. “If you’re looking for attention, this isn’t the way to do it.” She has that wrong. I need attention like a fish needs a snorkel. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=230))
- “You do know what a sympathy card is, Ally, don’t you?” ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=240))
- “Then why would you do such a thing?” I stand tall, but everything inside shrinks. ([Location 242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=242))

- And then I decide that the craziest, strangest, most unbelievable thing I could ever draw is me doing something right. ([Location 256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=256))

- They already think I’m a pain, so why add dumb to their list? It’s not like they can help, anyway. How can you cure dumb? ([Location 264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=264))
    - Note: sp3 prob?
- I pull out a book and open it, but the letters squiggle and dance. How are other people able to read letters that move? ([Location 308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=308))
- “I miss Grandpa,” I say. Three words that hold sadness like a tree holds leaves. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=321))

- Words. I can never get away from them. ([Location 353](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=353))
- “That spells your name, Ally. Ally Nickerson.” Who knew a second grader could understand what being humiliated feels like. ([Location 355](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=355))
- I’m glad he had a silver dollar day. ([Location 389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=389))

- She doesn’t get it. Being funny when you don’t mean to be is terrible. Having to laugh at yourself along with everyone else is humiliating. ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=396))

- I wish she could understand my world. But it would be like trying to explain to a whale what it’s like to live in the forest. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=411))
    - Note: I wish she could understand my world. But it would be like trying to explain to a whale what it’s like to live in the forest. sp9
- Travis does what Dad said never to do. He shows him his money. And not money like a regular person. A roll of money wrapped in an elastic band. ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=427))
- Travis smiles. Even I remember how Dad used to tell us never to smile when you get a number. Never. Even if it’s the best number in the world—and here he is smiling like he won the lottery. I try to look serious enough for the both of us. ([Location 438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=438))
- Dad’s rule of offering 20 percent less than what they offer. But Travis threw in something extra. ([Location 447](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=447))
- When people have low expectations of you, you can sometimes use it to your advantage.” Then he looks me right in the eyes and points at my nose. “As long as you don’t have low expectations of yourself. You hear?” ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=452))

- “Now, knock that off,” Mr. Daniels says. “I think Albert’s idea is fascinating. How Earth has recycled its water over and over. Extraordinary, Albert!” ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=546))
- Mr. Daniels actually seems to like that we’re different. ([Location 608](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=608))

- I want to give him an answer, but I have both too many words and not enough. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=646))
- I’ve made Shay happy. I feel terrible. And I know that I am going to feel even worse when the shade comes down over Albert’s face. When he looks sad. ([Location 695](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=695))
- I think of all of the red marks that cover my papers from teachers. How I hate to get them back. ([Location 700](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=700))
- And then my heart sinks, because I realize that I just was. ([Location 708](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=708))
- I’d like to help her break free from that. ([Location 757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=757))
- “It doesn’t bother me,” Keisha says. “That girl can flap her gums about me until the sun rises and sets again. I really don’t care.” ([Location 962](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=962))
- And then I realize I’ve never heard it from Mr. Daniels. And all of a sudden that bugs me. ([Location 987](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=987))
- I hear it in my head. Do better, Ally. And I would. I would magically do better and Mrs. Silver would carry a trophy for me so big, she’d have to carry it on her back. “Ally?” “Huh?” “I said that you can just put it in the cubby, then.” And the pictures in my head pop like bubbles. I walk away without taking it back. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=998))
- “I can see that. I can see why someone would want to avoid being with other people. A great number of them are not very nice to me . . . and, well . . .” ([Location 1023](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1023))
- “He inquired about my bruises. I think he hypothesized that they came from my parents. Then I had to speak to the school psychologist.” He shifts in his seat. “My parents rescue insects and arachnids from our home, taking them outside rather than killing them. It’s illogical for my parents to save spiders and hit their own son.” ([Location 1039](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1039))
- “Don’t throw that science at me,” Keisha says. “All I know is that you need to stick up for yourself. If you just let them do that, it’s like telling them it’s okay.” ([Location 1064](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1064))
- “That is the best. More people ought to put that girl in her place. She walks all over everybody.” ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1085))
- “Wow, this is fun—and hard,” I tell Travis. My arm is getting tired. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1127))
- I nod, but I have to admit that I’m getting awfully tired of walking away. ([Location 1146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1146))
- All I have to do is listen as he tells us the word’s meaning, and I can usually remember it because I make mind movies about each one and that helps me remember. ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1222))
- You can feel lonely when you’re alone, but the worst kind of lonely is when you’re in a room full of people, but you’re still alone. Or you feel like you are, anyway.” ([Location 1235](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1235))
- I look over at Keisha and Albert and realize that I have been. I’ve been lucky all along but didn’t see it. ([Location 1308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1308))
- I’m freaking out over having to be in charge of the book. I’d rather be in charge of teaching cats to play hockey. ([Location 1389](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1389))
- She’s disappointed that cookie dough will not work for letters. She and Albert figure out that the cookie dough expanded more than we thought it would and that’s why it made such a mess. But I just keep thinking that whenever I write something, it turns into a big mess. ([Location 1408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1408))
- I feel like a fish in a wire cage rather than a tank. “Can I go to lunch now?” ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1423))
- “When you look at letters, do they ever seem to move?” I’m confused. “Of course they do.” “They do?” He is wide-eyed. I nod but I’m not sure if I should. ([Location 1425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1425))
- But what really gets me is that in order for Mr. Daniels to come up with this plan, he must have thought of me outside of school—when he didn’t have to think of me. I bet other teachers have never let me sit in their head one second longer than they had to. ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1445))
- “Aw, Ally,” he says, “this thing that makes school hard for you . . . I think you might have something called dyslexia. And it means that, although it’s hard for you to read, it doesn’t mean you’re dumb.” He laughs a little. “In fact, you, Ally Nickerson, are far from it. Your brain just figures things out differently than other people.” ([Location 1514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1514))
- A chill runs through my whole body. I don’t have any choice but to believe him, because I can’t go another day thinking things will be like this forever. ([Location 1530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1530))
- ‘Everyone is smart in different ways. But if you judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree, it will spend its whole life thinking that it’s stupid.’” ([Location 1533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1533))
- “You know, I had a feeling you would be good at it. I think your mind learns in pictures, and it helps you be a really good chess player. We’ve played several times now and you have learned it fast and improved a lot without much time. Also, thinking in pictures?” He leans forward. “It’s one of the reasons you are such a good artist.” ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1598))
- “That is the birth of a star. The single most important thing that can happen in space. Well, the single most positive thing, anyway.” ([Location 1705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1705))
- “No! That’s not what I mean. I mean that we know that. But it doesn’t matter to us.” “However,” Albert says, “I do wish it was easier for you. We will not share your secret.” ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1723))
- “People ask what you want to be when you grow up. I know what kind of grown-up I want to be. But I don’t know who I am now.” Albert stretches his legs out. “There are always people ready to tell you who you are, like a nerd or a jerk or a wimp.” ([Location 1738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1738))
- My grandpa used to say to be careful with eggs and words, because neither can ever be fixed. The older I get, the more I realize how smart my grandpa was. ([Location 1746](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1746))
- “Teachers often leave special instructions for a sub, but she was not supposed to share my notes with the class. I figured I’d write her a note telling her you could do a picture so she didn’t pressure you to write . . . I know that you struggle and I thought I was helping you. But I see I shouldn’t have handled it by singling you out that way. Ally, I think you know I would never hurt you on purpose.” I do know that. And I am so relieved to hear him say it. “So, I’m sorry, Ally. I really am. I hope you can forgive me.” He holds out his hand to shake. And I shake back. ([Location 1791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1791))
- “Ally. I have three brothers. I am not capable of letting someone win.” He laughs a little. “I think you’re just invincible.” And then he winks and begins taking the pieces off the board and putting them in the box. I am sad the game is over and I’m relieved that I trust him again. And isn’t it funny—I’ve gone from invisible to invincible. ([Location 1810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1810))
- I guess maybe “I’m having trouble” is not the same as “I can’t.” ([Location 1859](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1859))
- “Any day is a good day for a party, Mr. D!” he says, and Shay looks annoyed with him. But her real dagger eyes are saved for me. At least she’s quiet for once. And that’s all perfectly fine with me. ([Location 1950](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=1950))
- As I draw, I think about my sketchbook and how I love it but don’t draw in it as much anymore. It used to be the only thing that made me happy. Now I have other things, too. ([Location 2136](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2136))
- “Elephants feel a wide range of emotions, but their behavior remains constant. On the outside, happy and sad often look the same.” ([Location 2192](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2192))
- I think of that word Mr. Daniels used when he talked about the famous people with dyslexia. Grit. He said it’s being willing to fail but try again—pushing through and sticking with something even if it’s hard. He also told us that a lot of those famous people were not afraid to make mistakes no matter how many they made. I think messing up will bother me less than it used to. ([Location 2281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2281))
- My mom was right. “I’m sorry” are powerful words. ([Location 2304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2304))
- A pile of old friendship bracelets. ([Location 2319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2319))
- “I think,” she says, “we should call you Alley Cat from now on. Go bother someone else.” At first I’m surprised, but then I realize it wasn’t a mistake to come over, because it felt like the right thing. Shay’s the one who decided to act mean, but at least I tried. I have to admit, though, I do feel sorry for her. ([Location 2337](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2337))
- “I’m tired of you beating on me all the time,” Albert says. “You have no right to treat me like that. And you don’t even fight one-on-one. You gang up on people like cowards.” Albert ([Location 2360](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2360))
- Then he stops walking and he’s wide-eyed looking at me. It gives me a chill the way he does it. “But really,” he says, “it just made everything hurt inside to watch them hurt you two, and I would have done anything in the universe to stop it.” ([Location 2375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2375))
- Her voice cracks. “I want you to know how sorry I am about the bumpy road we had for a while. I’m proud of all the strides you’re making. All the hard work you’re doing. We should have picked up on your learning differences before, but you were so bright . . . and, well, I hope you’ll give me another chance to help.” I nod, looking over at that poster, and think how I should have asked for help. But, at the time, it took more bravery than I had, I guess. ([Location 2415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2415))
- It’s like birds can swim and fish can fly. Impossible to possible. ([Location 2462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00KWG61P0&location=2462))
