## Highlights
- We all have problems that we work around for one reason or another instead of doing the logical thing. In my story, the important problem was my relationship with my landlord, not the frozen keypad. It’s the same thing with product development and user research. In far too many cases, people, teams, and organizations develop products that nobody needs, that do not solve any problem, or even worse, solve problems that users don’t care enough about.

- Many entrepreneurs are sure they have a problem worth solving due to their own personal experience. But, they often fail to recognize that an almost tangible “fact” in their mind is just an assumption that should be tested, validated, or most likely, invalidated.

- When you develop empathy toward another person, a future customer, you want to learn from that person about his or her needs, behavior, and problems. ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AOH2QP0&location=462))

- When you realize the importance of first finding out what humans need, then you start asking yourself if you should build a product, rather than if you can. ([Location 511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AOH2QP0&location=511))

- That said, there are two great times to ask the question: somewhere in the beginning of strategizing your product, and after launching it during the assessment phase (see Figure 1.1). ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AOH2QP0&location=518))

- • When you strategize, you try to figure out a lot of things about the need for your product, who your target audience is, and what your audience wants. Attaining this knowledge and wisdom will serve you well during the execution phase. Discovering user needs will help you figure out how the product should be built, because it will generate evidence, validation, and invalidation for various product features. • During the assessment phase, your users use the product, and you can learn whether or not your product meets their real needs. Beware though. If this is the first time you study your audience’s needs, you might find and learn things that will be very hard and costly to fix. The best time to answer the question is prior to execution. However, it is never too late or an inappropriate time to ask the question. The sooner you realize you need an evidence-based answer, the better. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AOH2QP0&location=520))

- Experience sampling is a strategic research technique that answers a high-level business (or roadmap) question rather than evaluating a design or product that already exists. ([Location 530](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01AOH2QP0&location=530))

- The key to experience sampling is asking the same question over and over again at random times during the day or week. This cadence and repetition strengthens your finding’s validity and allows you to identify patterns, like participants reporting greater satisfaction right after completing certain tasks.

- Experience sampling is not a way to evaluate product design. It is, however, helpful in evaluating whether or not there’s a need for a specific product you have in mind (or at hand). The key is to explore people’s current behavior without your product and evaluate whether or not they indicate a need that matches the value your product is (or will be) adding.

- MVP is an experiment that has a goal of learning as much as you can while making the smallest amount of effort. It’s a process, not an end goal. Therefore, although you might be asking yourself which features to include in an MVP, understanding needs and problems real people have through experience sampling (and other methods) puts you in a better position to come up with an experimentation process.
