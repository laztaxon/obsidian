- Chapter 3: clutter is your enemy! ([Location 703](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=703))
- discuss the Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception and how we can apply them to visual displays of information such as tables and graphs. We also discuss alignment, strategic use of white space, and contrast as important components of thoughtful design. Several examples are used to illustrate the lessons. ([Location 707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=707))
- When it comes to the form and function of our data visualizations, we first want to think about what it is we want our audience to be able to do with the data (function) and create a visualization (form) that will allow for this with ease. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=719))
- Exploratory analysis is what you do to understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight to others. ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=768))
- When we’re at the point of communicating our analysis to our audience, we really want to be in the explanatory space, meaning you have a specific thing you want to explain, a specific story you want to tell— ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=771))
- Too often, people err and think it’s OK to show exploratory analysis (simply present the data, all 100 oysters) when they should be showing explanatory (taking the time to turn the data into information that can be consumed by an audience: the two pearls). ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=773))
- First, To whom are you communicating? It is important to have a good understanding of who your audience is and how they perceive you. This can help you to identify common ground that will help you ensure they hear your message. Second, What do you want your audience to know or do? You should be clear how you want your audience to act and take into account how you will communicate to them and the overall tone that you want to set for your communication. It’s only after you can concisely answer these first two questions that you’re ready to move forward with the third: How can you use data to help make your point?

- by trying to communicate to too many different people with disparate needs at once, you put yourself in a position where you can’t communicate to any one of them as effectively as you could if you narrowed your target audience. Sometimes this means creating different communications for different audiences. Identifying the decision maker is one way of narrowing your audience.

- If you are the one analyzing and communicating the data, you likely know it best—you are a subject matter expert. This puts you in a unique position to interpret the data and help lead people to understanding and action. ([Location 823](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=823))
- When it really isn’t appropriate to recommend an action explicitly, encourage discussion toward one. Suggesting possible next steps can be a great way to get the conversation going because it gives your audience something to react to rather than starting with a blank slate. ([Location 828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=828))
- Storyboarding is perhaps the single most important thing you can do up front to ensure the communication you craft is on point. ([Location 979](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=979))
- When it comes to storyboarding, the biggest piece of advice I have is this: don’t start with presentation software. It is too easy to go into slide-generating mode without thinking about how the pieces fit together and end up with a massive presentation deck that says nothing effectively. Additionally, as we start creating content via our computer, something happens that causes us to form an attachment to it. ([Location 984](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B016DHQSM2&location=984))
- When it comes to explanatory analysis, being able to concisely articulate exactly who you want to communicate to and what you want to convey before you start to build content reduces iterations and helps ensure that the communication you build meets the intended purpose. Understanding and employing concepts like the 3-minute story, the Big Idea, and storyboarding will enable you to clearly and succinctly tell your story and identify the desired flow.
