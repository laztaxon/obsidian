## Highlights
- Breathe in and tell yourself that a new day has been offered to you, and you have to be here to live it. ([Location 138](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=138))
- Treat your in-breath and out-breath tenderly, nonviolently, as you would treat a flower. ([Location 147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=147))
- Do not fight against pain; do not fight against irritation or jealousy. Embrace them with great tenderness, as though you were embracing a little baby. Your anger is yourself, and you should not be violent toward it. The same thing goes for all of your emotions. ([Location 149](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=149))
- In Buddhist meditation, you do not turn yourself into a battlefield, with good fighting against evil. Both sides belong to you, the good and the evil. Evil can be transformed into good, and vice versa. They are completely organic things. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=158))
- It is not only your love that is organic; your hate is, too. So you should not throw anything out. All you have to do is learn how to transform your garbage into flowers. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=167))
- If you feel irritation or depression or despair, recognize their presence and practice this mantra: “Dear one, I am here for you.” You should talk to your depression or your anger just as you would to a child. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=171))
- Struggle is useless. Stop struggling. ([Location 179](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=179))
- Getting in touch with the beauty of nature makes life much more beautiful, much more real, and the more mindful and concentrated you are, the more deeply the sunset will reveal itself to you. ([Location 187](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=187))
- Being truly here is very important—being here for yourself, and for the one you love. How can you love if you are not here? A fundamental condition for love is your own presence. In order to love, you must be here. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=210))
- Some people live as though they are already dead. There are people moving around us who are consumed by their past, terrified of their future, and stuck in their anger and jealousy. They are not alive; they are just walking corpses. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=213))
- Many people aspire to go to a place where pain and suffering do not exist, a place where there is only happiness. This is a rather dangerous idea, for compassion is not possible without pain and suffering. It is only when we enter into contact with suffering that understanding and compassion can be born. Without suffering, we do not have the opportunity to cultivate compassion and understanding; and without understanding, there can be no true love. ([Location 226](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=226))
- The First Noble Truth of Buddhism is about recognizing the existence of suffering. ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=234))
- We should not try to escape from our pain. We should look at it directly. ([Location 239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=239))
- The fundamental condition for recognizing the presence of the other is your own true presence. What is loving? It is recognizing the presence of the other with your love. ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=294))
- This is the third miracle of mindfulness—maintaining this precious presence in order to benefit from it. If something negative comes to the surface, such as your despair and anger, or the despair and anger of your spouse, you need the energy of mindfulness to embrace it. ([Location 333](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=333))
- When you begin the practice, the seed of mindfulness is quite small, but if you cultivate it every day, it becomes much bigger and stronger. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=343))
- When you make breakfast, that is also a moment to cultivate mindfulness. Be mindful of the act of pouring hot water into a teapot. You breathe and you say, “I know that I am in the process of pouring hot water into the teapot,” and you smile. ([Location 354](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=354))
- The Buddha said, “The past no longer exists, and the future is not yet here.” There is only a single moment in which we can truly be alive, and that is the present moment. Being present in the here and now is our practice. ([Location 371](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=371))
- The Buddha taught that “I” is a combination of the following five elements: 1.  our form (physical body) 2.  our feelings 3.  our perceptions 4.  our mental formations 5.  our consciousness ([Location 374](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=374))
- We need to learn to see our physical form as a river. Our body is not a static thing—it changes all the time. It is very important to see our physical form as something impermanent, as a river that is constantly changing. Every cell in our body is a drop of water in that river. Birth and death are happening continuously, in every moment of our daily lives. ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=382))
- Nothing exists as a permanent entity; everything changes. It is said that we cannot step into the same river twice. If we look for a single, permanent entity in a river, we will not find it. The same is true of our physical body. There is no such thing as a self, no absolute, permanent entity to be found in the element we call “body.” ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=387))
- Perceptions can be either accurate or inaccurate, and every time we have a false perception, suffering occurs. We should train ourselves to see our feelings also as a river. In that river, each feeling is a drop of water. Feelings are born, take shape, last for a few moments, and then disappear. As with the physical form, birth and death of feelings occur in every moment. In meditation, we look mindfully at this river of feelings. We contemplate their arising, their remaining, and their disappearance. We witness their impermanence. ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=393))
- “This feeling is in me, it will stay for a while, and then it will disappear because it is impermanent.” Just by seeing the impermanence of feelings in this way we suffer a lot less. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=397))
- Perception is a river too. It is impermanent. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=400))
- We have to learn how to look at our perceptions without getting caught by them. We must always ask ourselves the question, “Is my perception accurate?” Just asking that question is a big help. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=403))
- In most cases, our perceptions are inaccurate, and we suffer because we are too sure of them. Look at your perceptions and smile to them. Breathe, look deeply into their nature, and you will see that there are many errors in them. For example, that person you are thinking about has no desire to harm you, but you think that he does. It is important not to be a victim of your false perceptions. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=404))
- You have to look into the deepest part of their nature in order to detect what is false about them. ([Location 408](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=408))
- the forty-nine mental formations, such as fear, hate, jealousy, love, understanding, compassion, hope, and so on. “Formation” is a slightly technical word we use to mean things, conditioned phenomena. ([Location 409](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=409))
- The elements of feelings and perceptions are considered mental formations, but these two are considered to be so significant that they are treated as their own separate skandhas. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=417))
- Consciousness is like the soil in which the seeds of the mental formations are preserved. Each of the fifty-one mental formations lies buried in the soil of consciousness in the form of a seed (bija in Sanskrit). When the conditions are sufficient, these seeds manifest as mental formations, such as perceptions, feelings, anger, compassion, and so on. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=419))
- These seeds are all there in the soil, but without rain they cannot manifest. Our practice is to recognize and water the positive seeds. If you recognize the seed of compassion in yourself, you should make sure that it is watered several times every day. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=423))
- In summary, the “I” is made up of the body and mind (namarupa in Sanskrit). The physical form is body, and all the other elements are mind. When we look deeply into these five elements, we do not see any absolute, permanent identity. The five rivers are impermanent. If you practice in such a way that harmony is established in the realm of the five elements, then joy, peace, and happiness will be possible. Through breathing, through bringing your mind back to your body, through the method of deep looking, you will reestablish harmony and peace in the realm of the five elements. You will become a happy formation, pleasing to encounter, and you will be able to bring happiness to the living beings around you. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=429))
- “I am here” is a practice, not a mere assertion. The verb “to be” here means to generate your own presence, your real presence. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00I8USOG6&location=436))
