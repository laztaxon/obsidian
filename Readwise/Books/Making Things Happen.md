## Highlights
- The simpler your view of what you do, the more power and focus you will have in doing it. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3AS&location=391))
- shoshin —which means beginner's mind,[1] or open mind—an essential part of many martial arts disciplines.

- "Human beings, who are almost unique [among animals] in having the ability to learn from the experience of others, are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so." ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3AS&location=407))
- As projects are completed or are canceled (and many development projects end this way [2]) every day, little is done to learn from what happened. It seems that managers in most organizations rarely reward people for seeking out this kind of knowledge. Perhaps it's fear of what they'll find (and the fear of being held accountable for it).

- there are only two kinds of theories: those that are wrong and those that are incomplete. ([Location 423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0026OR3AS&location=423))
