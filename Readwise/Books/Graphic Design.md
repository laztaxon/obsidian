## Highlights
- According to postmodernism, which emerged in the 1960s, it is futile to look for inherent meaning in an image or object because people will bring their own cultural biases and personal experiences to the process of interpretation.

- Photoshop, for example, is a systematic study of the features of an image (its contrast, size, color model, and so on). InDesign and QuarkXpress are structural explorations of typography: they are software machines for controlling leading, alignment, spacing, and column structures as well as image placement and page layout.

- What does transparency mean? Transparency can be used to construct thematic relationships. For example, compressing two pictures into a single space can suggest a conflict or synthesis of ideas (East/West, male/female, old/new). Designers also employ transparency as a compositional (rather than thematic) device, using it to soften edges, establish emphasis, separate competing elements, and so on.

- Layering is another universal concept with rising importance. Physical printing processes use layers (ink on paper), and so do software interfaces (from layered Photoshop files to sound or motion timelines). Transparency and layering have always been at play in the graphic arts. In today’s context, what makes them new again is their omnipresent accessibility through software.

- Software tools provide models of visual media, but they don’t tell us what to make or what to say. It is the designer’s task to produce works that are relevant to living situations (audience, context, program, brief, site) and to deliver meaningful messages and rich, embodied experiences.

- Yet, as these digital technologies afford greater freedom and convenience, they also require ongoing education and upkeep. This recurring learning curve, added to already overloaded schedules, often cuts short the creative window for concept development and formal experimentation. ([Location 204](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=204))
- People, places, thoughts, and things become familiar through repeated exposure. It stands to reason, then, that initial ideas and, typically, the top tiers of a Google search turn up only cursory results that are often tired and trite. Getting to more interesting territory requires the perseverance to sift, sort, and assimilate subjects and solutions until a fresh spark emerges and takes hold. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=210))
- Rather than focus on practical problems such as how to design a book, brochure, app, or website, this book encourages readers to experiment with the visual language of design. By “experiment,” we mean the process of examining a form, material, or process in a methodical yet open-ended way. To experiment is to isolate elements of an operation, limiting some variables in order to better study others. ([Location 220](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=220))
- Formstorming is an act of visual thinking—a tool for designers to unlock and deepen solutions to basic design problems. ([Location 245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=245))
- Formstorming moves the maker through automatic, easily conceived notions, toward recognizable yet nuanced concepts, to surprising results that compel us with their originality. The endurance required to stick with a subject through exhaustive iteration, dissection, synthesis, revision, and representation takes discipline and drive, but this level of immersion yields an unexpected and profound return on the creative investment. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=248))
- One Hundred Iterations Generating multiple iterations of one subject is a means of digging deeper. By repeatedly tapping into our mental database of associations and ideas, we are able to exhaust the obvious and get to fresher territory. This classic exercise asks designers to choose one subject and visually interpret it in one hundred ways. Basic semiotic principles—the icon, index, and symbol—are introduced to expand the scope of thinking and representation. Students make, capture, and appropriate imagery that, as a collection, has depth and breadth conceptually and formally, with an emphasis on excellence and innovation.

- Point, line, and plane are the building blocks of design. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=405))
- A point marks a position in space. In pure geometric terms, a point is a pair of x, y coordinates. It has no mass at all. Graphically, however, a point takes form as a dot, a visible mark. ([Location 429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=429))
- A series of points forms a line. A mass of points becomes texture, shape, or plane. Tiny points of varying size create shades of gray. ([Location 432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=432))
- In typography, the point is a period—the definitive end of a line. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=435))
- A line is an infinite series of points. Understood geometrically, a line has length, but no breadth. A line is the connection between two points, or it is the path of a moving point. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010U9BT64&location=456))
