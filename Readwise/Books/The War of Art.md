## Highlights
- Resistance arises from within. It is self-generated and self-perpetuated. Resistance is the enemy within.
- Resistance is like the Alien or the Terminator or the shark in Jaws. It cannot be reasoned with. It understands nothing but power
- Resistance is a force of nature. It acts objectively.
- We can use this. We can use it as a compass. We can navigate by Resistance, letting it guide us to that calling or action that we must follow before all others.
- The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which dictates that the battle must be fought anew every day
- We feed it with power by our fear of it. Master that fear and we conquer Resistance.
- The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight. At this point, Resistance knows we’re about to beat it.
- The awakening artist must be ruthless, not only with herself but with others. Once you make your break, you can’t turn around for your buddy who catches his trouser leg on the barbed wire
- The best and only thing that one artist can do for another is to serve as an example and an inspiration
- It goes without saying that this principle applies to drugs, shopping, masturbation, TV, gossip, alcohol, and the consumption of all products containing fat, sugar, salt, or chocolate.
- knows it has distracted us with a cheap, easy fix and kept us from doing our work.
- Anything that draws attention to ourselves through pain-free or artificial means is a manifestation of Resistance.
- The working artist will not tolerate trouble in her life because she knows trouble prevents her from doing her work
- Depression and anxiety may be real. But they can also be Resistance
- Instead of applying self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification and hard work, we simply consume a product.
- It seeks to achieve gratification not by honest work or a contribution made out of one’s experience or insight or love, but by the manipulation of others through silent (and not-so-silent) threat
- Casting yourself as a victim is the antithesis of doing your work. Don’t do it. If you’re doing it, stop
- Resistance also told me I shouldn’t seek to instruct, or put myself forward as a purveyor of wisdom; that this was vain, egotistical, possibly even corrupt, and that it would work harm to me in the end.
- We unplug ourselves from the grid by recognizing that we will never cure our restlessness by contributing our disposable income to the bottom line of Bullshit, Inc., but only by doing our work.
- Individuals who are realized in their own lives almost never criticize others. If they speak at all, it is to offer encouragement
- Remember our rule of thumb: The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it
- So if you’re paralyzed with fear, it’s a good sign. It shows you what you have to do.
- The part we create from can’t be touched by anything our parents did, or society did. That part is unsullied, uncorrupted; soundproof, waterproof, and bulletproof. In fact, the more troubles we’ve got, the better and richer that part becomes

- I feel it in my guts. I afford it the utmost respect, because I know it can defeat me on any given day as easily as the need for a drink can overcome an alcoholic
- a) you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important, and (b) you must do what’s important first
- Principle of Priority
- We show up every day. We might do it only because we have to, to keep from getting fired. But we do it. We show up every day
- We show up no matter what
- was crushed. Here I was, forty-two years old, divorced, childless, having given up all normal human pursuits to chase the dream of being a writer; now I’ve finally got my name on a big-time Hollywood production starring Linda Hamilton, and what happens? I’m a loser, a phony; my life is worthless, and so am
- The more you love your art/calling/enterprise, the more important its accomplishment is to the evolution of your soul, the more you will fear it and the more Resistance you will experience facing it.
- The professional, on the other hand, understands delayed gratification
- He knows that any job, whether it’s a novel or a kitchen remodel, takes twice as long as he thinks and costs twice as much. He accepts that. He recognizes it as reality.
- A pro views her work as craft, not art
- Like Somerset Maugham she doesn’t wait for inspiration, she acts in the anticipation of its apparition
- Highlighted Image
- The sign of the amateur is overglorification of and preoccupation with the mystery
- The amateur believes he must first overcome his fear; then he can do his work
- He knows if he caves in today, no matter how plausible the pretext, he’ll be twice as likely to cave in tomorrow.
- The professional conducts his business in the real world. Adversity, injustice, bad hops and rotten calls, even good breaks and lucky bounces all comprise the ground over which the campaign must be waged
- The Bhagavad-Gita tells us we have a right only to our labor, not to the fruits of our labor. All the warrior can give is his life; all the athlete can do is leave everything on the field.
- The professional loves her work. She is invested in it wholeheartedly. But she does not forget that the work is not her. Her artistic self contains many works and many performances
- I have one of those meetings with myself every Monday. I sit down and go over my assignments. Then I type it up and distribute it to myself.
- If we think of ourselves as a corporation, it gives us a healthy distance on ourselves
- There’s no mystery to turning pro. It’s a decision brought about by an act of will. We make up our minds to view ourselves as pros and we do it
- When I finish a day’s work, I head up into the hills for a hike. I take a pocket tape recorder because I know that as my surface mind empties with the walk, another part of me will chime in and start talking.
- screenplay resolves itself into a three-act structure; our symphony takes shape into movements; our plumbing-supply venture discovers its optimum chain of command
- You’re supposed to learn that things that you think are nothing, as weightless as air, are actually powerful substantial forces, as real and as solid as earth.
- The Ego is that part of the psyche that believes in material existence
- We fear discovering that we are more than we think we are. More than our parents/children/teachers think we are. We fear that we actually possess the talent that our still, small voice tells us
- we have a right to our labor but not to the fruits of our labor
