## Highlights
- These individuals have riches just as we say that we “have a fever,” when really the fever has us. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=403))
- To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=428))
- To have freedom from doing that which you dislike, but also the freedom and resolve to pursue your dreams without reverting to work for work’s sake (W4W). After years of repetitive work, you will often need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine your dreams, and revive hobbies that you let atrophy to near extinction. The goal is not to simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than leave you with a vacuum, but to pursue and experience the best in the world.

- Different is better when it is more effective or more fun. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=563))
- When I was in data storage sales, my first gig out of college, I realized that most cold calls didn’t get to the intended person for one reason: gatekeepers. If I simply made all my calls from 8:00–8:30 A.M. and 6:00–6:30 P.M., for a total of one hour, I was able to avoid secretaries and book more than twice as many meetings as the senior sales executives who called from 9–5. In other words, I got twice the results for ⅛ the time. ([Location 565](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=565))
- don’t mistake retirement for the goal. ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=585))
- Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and mental endurance all wax and wane. Plan accordingly. ([Location 591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=591))
- Personally, I now aim for one month of overseas relocation or high-intensity learning (tango, fighting, whatever) for every two months of work projects. ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=595))
- 6. Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses. ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=617))
- It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=623))
- Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time, which is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=633))
- I realized that on a scale of 1–10, 1 being nothing and 10 being permanently life-changing, my so-called worst-case scenario might have a temporary impact of 3 or 4. I believe this is true of most people and most would-be “holy sh*t, my life is over” disasters. Keep in mind that this is the one-in-a-million disaster nightmare. On the other hand, if I realized my best-case scenario, or even a probable-case scenario, it would easily have a permanent 9 or 10 positive life-changing effect.

- What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=816))
- If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think. ([Location 866](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=866))
- Whenever one of us began to set our sights lower, lose faith, or “accept reality,” the other would chime in via phone or e-mail like an AA sponsor: “Dude, are you turning into the bald fat man in the red BMW convertible?” ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002WE46UW&location=911))
