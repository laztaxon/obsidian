## Highlights
- A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically. ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=144))
- changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. ([Location 157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=157))
- What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.” ([Location 223](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=223))
- out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=252))
- A single decision is easy to dismiss. But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. ([Location 270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=270))
- What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=281))
- Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=290))
- The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=297))
- A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change. ([Location 317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=317))
- habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=321))
- Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=329))
- Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=357))
- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. ([Location 359](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=359))
- you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=369))
- Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=387))
- It makes no sense to restrict your satisfaction to one scenario when there are many paths to success. ([Location 394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=394))
- When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=400))
- It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. ([Location 403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=403))
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. ([Location 407](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=407))

- This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth. ([Location 414](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=414))

- Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=431))

- The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=439))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=440))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=443))

- Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=444))

- “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity. ([Location 458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=458))

- They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.

- In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=534))

- Your goal is simply to win the majority of the time. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=551))
    - Tags: [[blue]] 
- Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. ([Location 554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=554))
- try, fail, learn, try differently. ([Location 623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07D23CFGR&location=623))
