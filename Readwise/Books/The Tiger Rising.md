## Highlights
- He had been out in the woods behind the Kentucky Star Motel, way out in the woods, not really looking for anything, just wandering, hoping that maybe he would get lost or get eaten by a bear and not have to go to school ever again. ([Location 8](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=8))
- it was like staring at the sun itself, angry and trapped in a cage. ([Location 12](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=12))
- “There ain’t no point in crying,” his father had said afterward. “Crying ain’t going to bring her back.” It had been six months since that day, six months since he and his father had moved from Jacksonville to Lister, and Rob had not cried since, not once. ([Location 23](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=23))
- He made all his feelings go inside the suitcase; he stuffed them in tight and then sat on the suitcase and locked it shut. ([Location 28](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=28))
- Rob sat there and took it. If he fought back, it lasted longer. If he didn’t fight back, sometimes they got bored and left him alone. ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=44))
- And each picture made Rob feel cool and sweet inside, like a drink of water on a hot day. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=75))
- In the book, the picture from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel showed God reaching out and touching Adam. It was like they were playing a game of tag, like God was making Adam “it.” ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=77))
- He thought about the tiger. He thought about God and Adam. And he thought about Sistine. He did not think about the rash. He did not think about his mother. And he did not think about Norton and Billy Threemonger. He kept the suitcase closed. ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=79))
- “I’m from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,” Sistine said, “home of the Liberty Bell, and I hate the South because the people in it are ignorant. And I’m not staying here in Lister. My father is coming to get me next week.” She looked around the room defiantly. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=88))
- “Rob,” said the teacher, “I need you to go to the principal’s office.” ([Location 100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=100))

- Let me be up-front and honest with you. I think it might be a good idea if we had you stay home for a few days. What we’ll do is just give that old medicine more of a chance to kick in, let it start working its magic on you, and then we’ll have you come back to school when your legs have cleared up. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=126))
- I’ll just write your parents — I mean your father — a note, and tell him what’s what; he can give me a call if he wants. We can talk about it.” ([Location 131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=131))
- He was free. ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=137))
- Rob stood up so that he could see her better. He caught sight of her pink dress; it looked all crumpled, like a wadded-up tissue. He saw her arms still going like mad. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=151))
- “Leave her alone!” he shouted, not believing that the words were coming from him. ([Location 154](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=154))
- he did not know where his drawing of the tiger was, but he still had Mr. Phelmer’s note in his back pocket and that was all that truly mattered to him, the note that proved that he would never have to come back. ([Location 167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=167))
- It was his policy not to say things, but it was a policy he was having a hard time maintaining around Sistine. ([Location 182](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=182))
- but the two of them sat apart from it all, as if their seat was an island in the sea of sweat and exhaust. ([Location 197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=197))
- He was glad, almost, that Norton and Billy were there to beat him into silence. ([Location 207](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=207))
- The rain beat a sad rhythm on the roof of the motel. ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=210))
- “You got to fight them, you know. Them boys. I know you don’t want to. But you got to fight them, else they won’t ever leave you alone.” ([Location 218](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=218))
- After supper, his father fell asleep in the recliner, with his head thrown back and his mouth open. He snored, and his feet — big, with crooked toes — jerked and trembled. In between the snores, his stomach growled long and loud, as if he was the hungriest man in the world. ([Location 237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=237))
- It wasn’t until he started working on the dress that Rob realized he was carving Sistine. He stopped for a minute and held the wood out in front of him and shook his head in wonder. It was just like his mother had always said: You could never tell what would come out of the wood. It did what it wanted and you just followed. ([Location 241](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=241))
- In his suitcase of not-thoughts, there were also not-wishes. He kept the lid closed on them, too. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=254))
- That was what the sun made him think of. The funeral. And so he didn’t care if he ever saw the sun again. He didn’t care if the whole state did turn into a swamp. ([Location 267](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=267))
- His father must have remembered, too, because he stopped halfway through the song and shook his head and cursed softly under his breath. ([Location 277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=277))
- “Go on and tell me why you ain’t in school.” ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=297))
- “You ain’t going to forget what I told you ’bout them legs, are you?” ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=310))
- “You got to let the sadness rise on up.” ([Location 315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=315))
- She didn’t say “A real one?” She didn’t say “Are you crazy?” She didn’t say “You’re a big old liar.” She said one word: “Where?” And Rob knew then that he had picked the right person to tell. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=343))
- He thought for a minute about one of the not-wishes he had buried deepest: a friend. ([Location 368](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=368))
- Rob felt a familiar loneliness rise up and drape its arm over his shoulder. She wasn’t staying. ([Location 379](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=379))
- He shrugged and bent to scratch his legs. He told himself that he didn’t care. He told himself that she was leaving soon, anyway. But when he looked up and saw her getting smaller and smaller, it reminded him of his dream. He remembered Sistine riding into the woods on the back of the tiger. And suddenly, he couldn’t bear the thought of watching her disappear again. ([Location 400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=400))
- ‘Tiger, tiger, burning bright, in the forests of the night.’ That poem. It’s just like that. He burns bright.” ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=416))
- The mere thought of letting the tiger go made his legs itch like crazy. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=428))
- Then Rob remembered the name of the feeling that was pushing up inside him, filling him full to overflowing. It was happiness. That was what it was called. ([Location 443](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=443))
- “Caroline,” Rob said softly, cracking his suitcase open and letting the word slip out. Sistine gave him another businesslike nod of her head. “Okay,” she said. “I’ll come back tomorrow. And we’ll make our plans for letting the tiger go.” ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=500))
- “Go on and grab ahold of the other end. Help me fold this up.” ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=543))
- Willie May nodded her head, but she wasn’t listening. She was looking past Rob, past the white sheet, past the laundry room, past the Kentucky Star. ([Location 552](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=552))
- “You ain’t going to believe what I got to show you,” Beauchamp hollered at him. ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=588))
- Rob, terrified that keys to the cage existed and that they were about to be handed to him, nodded. ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=613))
- “He ain’t got a name. You got to name something before you toss it a piece of meat?” ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=621))
- On the hair-raising ride back to the Kentucky Star, Rob realized who the tiger’s stare reminded him of. It was Sistine. He knew that when he told her he had the keys to the cage, her eyes would glow with the same fierce light. He knew that she would insist that now they had to let the tiger go. ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=630))
- In the meantime, you keep your mouth shut.” ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=635))
- Come on,” she said. She started to run. Rob ran, too. But the keys to the cage felt heavy in his pocket, ([Location 643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=643))
- She rattled the cage as if she were the one who was locked up. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=665))
- “The first one God ever thought up. The first-ever green. You and me, we see the world the same.” ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=733))
- “My mama,” said Rob. ([Location 766](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=766))
- And while he worked, the keys jingled in his pocket, and he knew that soon Sistine would be out of school and that she would demand again that he unlock the cage and let the tiger go. ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=772))
- “You know,” said Rob, “you don’t always got to get in fights. Sometimes, if you don’t hit them back, they leave you alone.” She whirled around and faced him. “I want to get in fights,” she said fiercely. “I want to hit them back. Sometimes, I hit them first.” ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=781))
- “Well,” she said, “look who’s here.” She kept her hand balled up, as if she was still searching for something to hit. ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=791))
- “All I am is somebody speaking the truth. And the truth is: there ain’t nothing you can do for this tiger except to let it be.” “It’s not right,” said Sistine. “Right ain’t got nothing to do with it,” muttered Willie May. “Sometimes right don’t count.” ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=827))
- As they walked back to the Kentucky Star, Rob thought about what Willie May had said about the tiger rising on up. It reminded him of what she had said about his sadness needing to rise up. And when he thought about the two things together, the tiger and his sadness, the truth circled over and above him and then came and landed lightly on his shoulder. He knew what he had to do. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=845))
- “He’s afraid,” said Sistine. “He’s afraid of the tiger. That’s why he’s making you feed him.” Rob nodded. That was another truth he had known without knowing it, the same as he had known that Sistine’s father was not coming back. He must, he realized, know somewhere, deep inside him, more things than he had ever dreamed of. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=877))
- He ran so fast, it looked to Rob like he was flying. His muscles moved like a river; it was hard to believe that a cage had ever contained him. It didn’t seem possible. The tiger went leaping through the grass, moving farther and farther away from Rob and Sistine. He looked like the sun, rising and setting again and again. And watching him go, Rob felt his own heart rising and falling, beating in time. ([Location 904](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=904))
- Rob looked at his father’s hands. They were the hands that had held the gun that shot the tiger. They were the hands that put the medicine on his legs. They were the hands that had held him when he cried. They were complicated hands, Rob thought. ([Location 998](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B002NC733A&location=998))
