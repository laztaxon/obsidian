## Highlights
- Shipping, because it doesn’t count if you don’t share it. ([Location 252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=252))
- Work, because it’s not a hobby. You might not get paid for it, not today, but you approach it as a professional. The muse is not the point, excuses are avoided, and the work is why you are here. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=253))
- creativity is not an event, it’s simply what we do, whether or not we’re in the mood. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=259))
- It is a persistent, stepwise approach that we pursue for its own sake and not because we want anything guaranteed in return. ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=285))
- It’s a path defined by resilience and generosity. It’s outward focused, but not dependent on reassurance or applause. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=291))
- At the heart of the creative’s practice is trust: the difficult journey to trust in your self, the often hidden self, the unique human each of us lives with. ([Location 298](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=298))
- Followers aren’t searching. They’re simply following in the footsteps of the people before them. ([Location 303](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=303))
- Leaders seek to make things better, to contribute and to find firm footing. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=304))
- Your part matters. Your art matters. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=310))
- The real question is: “Do I care enough to do it again?” ([Location 313](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=313))
- When you choose to produce creative work, you’re solving a problem. Not just for you, but for those who will encounter what you’ve made. ([Location 319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=319))

- Art is something we get to do for other people. ([Location 321](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=321))

- Their output is different, the circumstances are different, and the timing is different, but the practice remains. ([Location 329](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=329))

- Maybe instead of a series of steps to follow, we’d be better off understanding how the world actually works now. ([Location 330](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=330))
- A good process can lead to good outcomes, but it doesn’t guarantee them. ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=334))
- Reassurance is futile. ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=335))
- Professionals produce with intent. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=339))
- Leaders are imposters. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=340))
- Good taste is a skill. Passion is a choice. ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=343))
- For the work we’d like to do, the reward comes from the fact that there is no guarantee, that the path isn’t well lit, that we cannot possibly be sure it’s going to work. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=367))
- It doesn’t have to be this way. We don’t have to wait to be picked and we don’t have to stand by, hoping that we will feel our calling. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=375))
- Artists make change happen. Artists are humans who do generous work that might not work. ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=385))
- It is to recognize that it is not all about you, and that you have a communal function you can serve to help everyone get along. ([Location 390](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=390))
- You were born ready to make art. But you’ve been brainwashed into believing that you can’t trust yourself enough to do so. ([Location 397](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=397))
- Your work is too important to be left to how you feel today. On the other hand, committing to an action can change how we feel. If we act as though we trust the process and do the work, then the feelings will follow. ([Location 404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=404))
- If we believe that it’s not our turn, that we’re not talented enough, we’ll do whatever we can to make that story true. ([Location 413](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=413))
- If you want to change your story, change your actions first. When we choose to act a certain way, our mind can’t help but rework our narrative to make those actions become coherent. We become what we do. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=417))
- If we condition ourselves to work without flow, it’s more likely to arrive. ([Location 426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=426))
- Flow is a symptom of the work we’re doing, not the cause of it. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=428))
- Again and again, the work falls into a pattern, often containing counterintuitive twists and turns. ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=434))
- Sometimes, we opt for more instead of better. But better is better than more. ([Location 437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=437))
- Once you decide to trust your self, you will have found your passion. You’re not born with it, and you don’t have just one passion. It’s not domain-specific: it’s a choice. Our passion is simply the work we’ve trusted ourselves to do. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=440))
- Good processes, repeated over time, lead to good outcomes more often than lazy processes do. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=452))
- Focusing solely on outcomes forces us to make choices that are banal, short-term, or selfish. It takes our focus away from the journey and encourages us to give up too early. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=452))

- “You can’t really decide to paint a masterpiece. You just have to think hard, work hard, and try to make a painting that you care about. Then, if you’re lucky, your work will find an audience for whom it’s meaningful.” ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=462))

- Most of all, what we need from a great boss, for our self, is somebody who will see us for what we are capable of. You would never work for somebody who treats you the way that you treat your self. It’s time to start training the boss that is you. Time to start trusting your self, trusting the process, and trusting that you are actually as capable as you are. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=476))

- there’s a huge gap between a good decision and a good outcome. A good decision is based on what we know of the options and the odds. A good outcome happens or it doesn’t: it is a consequence of the odds, not the hidden answer. ([Location 486](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=486))

- That’s because what we seek and how we create aren’t the same thing. Reassurance is futile—and focusing on outcomes at the expense of process is a shortcut that will destroy your work. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=493))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- most of what we seek to do will not work. But our intent—the intent of being of service, of making things better, of building something that matters—is an essential part of the pattern. Because most of us, most of the time, act without intent. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=498))
    - Tags: [[orange]] 
- Doing the work simply involves acknowledging that we’re capable of caring enough to make the work better. To learn, to see, and to improve. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=503))

- The very nature of innovation is to act as if—to act as if you’re on to something, as if it’s going to work, as if you have a right to be here. Along the way, you can discover what doesn’t work on your way to finding out what does. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=515))

- When we embrace imposter syndrome instead of working to make it disappear, we choose the productive way forward. The imposter is proof that we’re innovating, leading, and creating. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B088QLT891&location=526))

- It’s not important that the kids developed their musical skills when they were eleven. It’s important that they developed the habit of identity. When they looked in the mirror, they saw themselves as musicians, as artists, as people who had committed to a journey.
