## Highlights
- **The UI design principals are:**
  1. Place users in control of the interface
  2. Make it comfortable to interact with a product
  3. Reduce cognitive load
  4. Make user interfaces consistent ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hceeyxscec0cvv7a4166sscw))
    - Note: Q: What are the four UI design principles mentioned in "The 4 Golden Rules of UI Design | Adobe XD Ideas"?
      A: The four UI design principles are: 1) Place users in control of the interface, 2) Make it comfortable to interact with a product, 3) Reduce cognitive load, and 4) Make user interfaces consistent.
- 1. Place users in control of the interface
  Good UIs instill a sense of control in their users. Keeping users in control makes them comfortable; they will learn quickly and gain a fast sense of mastery.
  Make actions reversible – be forgiving
  This rule means that the user should always be able to quickly backtrack whatever they are doing. This allows users to explore the product without the constant fear of failure — when a user knows that errors can be easily undone, this encourages exploration of unfamiliar options. On the contrary, if a user has to be extremely careful with every action they take, it leads to a slower exploration and nerve-racking experience that no one wants.
  Perhaps the most common GUIs where users have the ‘Undo/Redo’ option are text and graphics editors. While writing text or creating graphics, ‘Undo’ lets users make changes and go back step-by-step through changes that were made. ‘Redo’ lets users undo the undo, which means that once they go back a few steps, they are able to move forward through their changes again.
  ‘Undo’ can be extremely helpful when users choose system function by mistake. In this case, the undo function serves as an ’emergency exit,’ allowing users to leave the unwanted state. One good example of such emergency exits is Gmail’s notification message with an undo option when users accidentally delete an email.

    - Note: UI rule: Keep users in control, actions reversible.
      Good UI design allows users to be in charge of what they're doing. This makes users feel comfortable and helps them learn quickly. The design should also allow users to undo any mistakes they make easily. This means that users can explore the product without worrying about mistakes. The most common example is the "Undo/Redo" options in text and graphics editors. "Undo" lets users make changes and go back step-by-step through changes that were made. "Redo" lets users undo the undo, which means that once they go back a few steps, they can move forward through their changes again. The undo function is like an 'emergency exit,' allowing users to leave a mistake. One example of an emergency exit is Gmail's notification message with an undo option when users accidentally delete an email.
- Create an easy-to-navigate interface
  Navigation should always be clear and self-evident. Users should be able to enjoy exploring the interface of any software product. Even complex B2B products full of features shouldn’t intimidate users so that they are afraid to press a button. Good UI puts users in their comfort zone by providing some context of where they are, where they’ve been, and where they can go next:
  • **Provide visual cues**. Visual cues serve as reminders for users. Allow users to navigate easily through the interface by providing points of reference as they move through a product interface. Page titles, highlights for currently selected [navigation options](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/information-architecture/information-architecture-navigation/), and other visual aids give users an immediate view of where they are in the interface. A user should never be wondering, “Where am I?” or “How did I get to this screen?”
  • **Predictability***.* Users should be provided with cues that help them predict the result of an action. A user should never be wondering, “What do I need to press in order to do my task?” or “What is this button for?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcef3zzyz9qbsnxnk020pg0q))
    - Note: Clear navigation is essential for good UI.
      UI design is about making software easy to use and explore. Navigation should be clear, and users should not be afraid to press buttons. Good UI design provides context and visual cues to help users know where they are, where they've been, and where they can go next. This includes page titles, highlights for selected options, and other visual aids. UI designers also need to make software predictable so that users can understand the result of their actions.
