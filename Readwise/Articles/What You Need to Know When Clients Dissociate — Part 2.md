- Category: #articles
- Summary: In Part 2 of the series on clients dissociating, the article discusses the importance of helping clients reframe their dissociation experiences as a survival mechanism rather than a pathology. By reconnecting with their pre-frontal cortex, clients can regain executive functioning and better understand their dissociative phenomenon. Therapists should also help clients identify physical cues that signal the onset of dissociation, allowing for intervention before it fully takes over. The article suggests various grounding techniques that can help clients stay present and empowered instead of dissociating. Ultimately, the goal is for clients to use dissociation only when it is truly necessary for their safety.
