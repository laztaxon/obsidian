- Category: #articles
- Summary: Figma's variables and modes feature allows for responsive UI design in which components automatically adapt to different screen sizes. Breakpoints, which define points where the design adapts, can be implemented using media queries in CSS. While Figma does not have a built-in breakpoint feature, designers can manually set up responsive design using variables and modes. Variables can be set up in Figma to define different values for color, number, string, and boolean variables. Modes can be used to switch elements and variants based on screen size, and breakpoints can be added to ensure designs resize within specified ranges. By combining variables, modes, and auto layout, designers can create responsive designs in Figma.

## Highlights
- with the **release of variables in June 2023**, Figma added some spark to the work of responsive UI design. With variables and modes, we can set up responsive designs whereby **components automatically adapt to the given screen size** they are placed on, and we can ensure that those frames only **resize within the provided breakpoints** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbetwve0s1qyawq10cgz9xqz))
- A breakpoint defines a certain point where the design (may) adapt. So, while we still use responsive behaviour between the breakpoints, we re-consider the general layout once we enter a new range. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbeva2n0zyt3rastrgg9549d))
- In the realm of CSS, breakpoints are implemented through what’s known as media queries. A media query essentially tells the browser, “Hey there, browser, check the width, and if it’s larger or smaller than X, then display the design/changes I defined for that situation.” You can set up as many media queries as you want and need, but you’ll typically find that most designs use around 3 to 5.

- Add some magic with **variables to automate which component gets displayed** and set stops at certain **minimum and maximum points to stay inside your breakpoint range** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbevf51n2kf33mj6ja5v0420))
- At the time of writing this article, we have colour variables, number variables, string variables, and boolean variables. We are also eagerly awaiting the release of typography and image variables, which Figma has promised for the end of 2023. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbevgk27r33hppj3svvpfvze))
- To set up variables in Figma, simply click the local variables panel on the right-hand side in the properties panel, and through the modal, you can now select the type of variable you want to add, give it a name, and assign a value.

- We can set up different variable collections. Thus, we could have one collection for colours, one for sizes, and mixed collections. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbevn6aq0eay0h8mf04eyqe7))
