- Document Note: Sam Altman, along with other investors, is backing the AI startup Induced AI founded by two teenagers. The company aims to help businesses automate browser-nativeworkflows. Induced AI allows users to input workflows in plain English, converts the instructions into pseudo-code in real-time, and then launches Chromium-based browser instances to complete various steps of a workflow. The startup has raised $2.3 million in seed funding and is working on expanding its customer base and developing new use cases.

## Highlights
- [Induced AI](https://www.induced.ai/), founded this year, enables businesses to input their workflows in plain English, subsequently converting the instructions into pseudo-code in realtime for numerous repetitive tasks typically managed by back offices.
  The eponymous platform launches Chromium-based browser instances, and uses its tech to read on-screen content and control the browser similarly to a human in order to complete various steps of a workflow. This allows the browser instances to interact with websites even if they don’t have an API, Aryan Sharma, Induced AI co-founder and chief executive, showed in a demo.

- Induced AI applies a bi-directional interaction system, enabling human involvement in certain steps as needed, while autonomously managing the remainder, said Sharma. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcedzvmd11g37f33znarsjr9))

- We’ve purpose-built a browser environment on top of Chromium that’s designed for autonomous workflow runs. It has its own memory, file system, and authentication credentials (email, phone number) to do complex flows. As far as I know, we’re the first to take this approach of redesigning the browser for native AI agent use. So complex logins, 2fa (we auto fill in auth codes/SMSs), file downloads, storing and re-using data is possible that other autonomous agents can’t do,” said Sharma.

- In contrast to existing models, where an individual trying to program such instructions might spend hours on tasks like tagging all HTML elements, Induced AI eliminates the need for manual tagging. Its system can discern the necessary information from English instructions and dynamically adjust them as needed for tweaks.
  Induced AI is certainly not alone. Chances are you have seen several similar modern Robotic Process Automation concepts floating around on X and Hacker News in recent months. But Sharma highlighted several factors that set Induced AI apart from others. Induced AI can run multiple tasks simultaneously and it’s fully remote, for instance, he said.
