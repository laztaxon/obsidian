## Highlights
- There are two core principles you should stick to while creating the IA:
  it has to be easy to comprehend and navigate;
  it has to be easily scalable (i.e. it has to be easy to add new features to the app after its release). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824338))
- 1. Hierarchy ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824341))
- Basically, you create one index page that has links to other pages, which in turn can also contain links to more subpages. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824342))
- This pattern is a good fit for mobile apps that have to have the same structure as desktop websites. However, if you get a multi-faceted navigation structure as the result of using this pattern, it can be inconvenient to use on small screens. So, in this case, it is better to reconsider your choice and opt for another pattern with less complicated navigation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824343))
- 2. Hub & Spoke ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824344))
- you have one index page (the so-called hub) with spokes to navigate to. In order to switch to another spoke, users have to go back to the hub first. Therefore, this pattern encourages users to focus on one task at a time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824348))
- This pattern is good for multi-functional apps where each tool or feature has its own purpose and internal navigation. However, if your app is aimed at users who would like to multi-task, this pattern won’t work well. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824349))
- 3. Nested Doll ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824350))
- This one is a linear pattern that allows users to move from the index page with a general overview of the content to the pages with more details. As it is linear, the navigation is perceived to be clear, so users are less likely to get lost in the app’s content. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824351))
- It has found a wide application on Android. The nested doll pattern is a good choice for apps that are focused on one particular topic or a couple of closely related ones. However, consider that it may be too slow to switch between sections if you have many levels in your IA. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824354))
- 4. Tabbed View ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824355))
- This pattern suits apps that are created to be tools (e.g. for searching and comparing products from many categories and sub-categories; a great example is Amazon with their tons of goods and accessible tabbed navigation to browse through them) and to encourage the user to multi-task. However, watch out for the complexity of your IA with this pattern - you should keep it as simple as possible to make it user-friendly.

- 5. Dashboard ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824361))
- It has one significant advantage: it allows users to consume the most important information, analyze and prioritize it at a glance. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824365))
- It is a good fit for apps that are built to be used on a tablet rather than a smartphone. It suits apps that are content-based and multi-functional tools. However, it is quite easy to overload the index page with elements and make your users feel lost in a sea of information as a result. So, you should pay particular attention to testing how users interact with this interface and use their feedback to improve the UX. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824368))
- 6. Filtered View ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824371))
- Filtered view allows users to switch between alternative views by filtering the content they are seeing ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824372))
- This pattern is an excellent choice for apps that are based on displaying huge amounts of content (images, videos, etc.). However, it shouldn’t be overloaded with too many filters as this would make it difficult to display them on a small smartphone screen ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824374))

- Create the Content Inventory First ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285414/16824383))
- Before you even start considering which pattern to choose for your IA, you need to know what elements your IA will consist of. So, we suggest making a list of all the content that needs to be in the app: all the titles, meta elements, audio files, videos, texts, documents, etc. This will help you group the components, prioritize them, and get rid of those that are unnecessary.
