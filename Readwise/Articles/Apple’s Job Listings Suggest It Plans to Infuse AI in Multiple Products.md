- Summary: Apple has been sharing job opportunities that indicate its plans to incorporate generative AI into multiple products. The company is working on a generative AI-based developer experience platform, a conversational AI platform, and text-generation technology for tasks such as long-form text generation and question-answering. Apple is also looking to work with individuals who can make models work locally on devices. Bloomberg reported that Apple is set to invest over $1 billion per year in generative AI-based products and features, with plans to use large language models to power features for Siri and other apps. While Apple's rivals have already deployed AI-powered features, Apple has not yet released anything for consumers.

## Highlights
- The company aims to tap into large language models (LLMs) to power features for Siri and the Messages app — including things like sentence completion — for the next version of iOS, per Bloomberg. The report noted that Apple is exploring generative AI-aided features in apps and services like Xcode to help developers (the job listing above could be indicative of that), AI-generated playlists for Apple Music and AI-assisted writing for Pages and Keynote.
