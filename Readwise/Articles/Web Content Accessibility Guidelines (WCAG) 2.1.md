- Abstract
  Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.
  WCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](http://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.
  WCAG 2.1 extends [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) [[WCAG20](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-WCAG20)], which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. The WG intends that for policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The publication of WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. While WCAG 2.0 remains a W3C Recommendation, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.1 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating Web accessibility policies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hceeqy92neehq5xydc2rn0c8))
    - Note: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 is a set of rules that make it easier for people with disabilities to use the internet. These rules help people who are blind, have low vision, are deaf or hard of hearing, have trouble moving their body, have trouble speaking, and those with learning and cognitive disabilities. These rules also make websites work better on computers, phones, and tablets. Following these rules makes web content more accessible to everyone. The rules are written in a way that can be measured and tested to make sure they work. If a website follows these rules, it is also following the previous version, WCAG 2.0. Following these rules will make sure that websites are accessible to as many people as possible, and it is important for everyone to try to follow them.
