- Document Note: 1. What is Midjourney's "weirdness" parameter, and how could it be useful?
   Answer: Midjourney's "weirdness" parameter is a tool that generates images that are unexpected while still being photorealistic. It could be useful for producing more creative and unique visual material.
   2. Why does the author believe that AI image generators should not produce photorealistic images by default?
   Answer: The author believes that AI image generators should not produce photorealistic images by default because they have the potential to produce a new visual material that could be enriched by hallucinations. By treating AI hallucination as a parameter, the images produced could be beyond the control of their makers and offer a glimpse into the machine from the inside.
   3. How do AI hallucinations show us the machine from the inside?
   Answer: AI hallucinations show us the machine from the inside because they are beyond the control of their makers and can offer unexpected and unique images. Like glitches, they offer a glimpse into the inner workings of the machine and can generate new visual languages.
   AI-generated images are becoming more realistic, but less creative and surprising. AI tool makers have been working to l 
   imit AI hallucinations to avoid dreamlike and uncanny images. However, some argue that AI hallucinations could enrich the visual material produced by these machines and regain a bit of strangeness and poetry. This could be achieved by going beyond default photorealistic aesthetics and using more complex prompts or developing new AI tools that question the generation process and help develop new visual languages.
   
- Summary: AI-generated images are becoming more realistic, but less creative and surprising. AI tool makers have been working to limit AI hallucinations to avoid dreamlike and uncanny images. However, some argue that AI hallucinations could enrich the visual material produced by these machines and regain a bit of strangeness and poetry. This could be achieved by going beyond default photorealistic aesthetics and using more complex prompts or developing new AI tools that question the generation process and help develop new visual languages.

## Highlights
- **AI image generators can produce anything with their giant dataset and their powerful algorithms, why should they produce photorealistic images by default?** Midjourney and DALL-E are more than just cameras that can take any photographs, they are machines producing a new visual material. A material that could be enriched by hallucinations.
  For the tools’ developers, treating AI hallucination as a parameter might be felt as a loss of control. And that’s also why AI hallucinations are fascinating to me: they show us images that are beyond the control of their makers. Like glitches, hallucinations show us the machine from the inside.

- Midjourney’s new “weirdness” parameter could be a step in that direction: the images generated usually look more unexpected, but still look photorealistic. Here are images from the same prompts with the weirdness parameter at different levels.
