## Highlights
- Good Interaction design
  helps people to accomplish their goals.
  effectively communicates interactivity and functionality(what user can do).
  informs user about state changes(file has been saved, or any feedback), while they interact.
  prevents user error or mistakes, like the system asks user to confirm potentially harmful action(i.e. deletion). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1403588951/16092330))
- Good Information Architecture
  organizes, categorizes, and prioritizes the information based on user needs and business objectives.
  makes it easy to understand and move through information presented.
  flexible to accommodate growth and adapt to change.
  appropriate for the audience. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1403588951/16092332))
- the Skeleton should answer these questions:
  What visual form of all things that will be presented on screen
  How interactions will be presented and arranged
  How will users move around the site, or application
  How content will be presented clearly ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1403588951/16092334))
- Functional Vs Content requirements
  The feature is having a media player for songs, while the content is the audio files for these songs. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1403588951/16092337))
- how those 5 elements work together, we start by the Strategy, which is the foundation of any successful UX. Strategy becomes Scope when user & business needs translated to requirements for content & functionality.
  Scope is given Structure when we define the ways of interaction with the system functionality, the system response, and how information is organized. Sketching each screen of the system(i.e. using wireframes) to present the areas of interactions and structure defined in Structure, and how information will be presented clearly, is what we do in Skeleton. Finally, In Surface, we take all the work and decisions we have made into the final visual presentation. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1403588951/16092340))
