## Highlights
- It’s also important to understand that accessibility is almost always intersectional; norms of gender, religion, or class may further include or exclude people from technology. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1403756165/16099769))
- As UX researchers, we often find similar—sometimes even identical—issues that impact users’ ability to interact with their tech; and while the restrictions across users and use cases vary, the design implications are similar. For example, bright sunshine, low vision, or a cracked phone screen can all be factors that motivate the need for better contrast ratios.
  Living in an increasingly globalized world means that there's an opportunity to proactively build ethical and meaningful products that are inclusive of societies and cultures worldwide. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1403756165/16099771))
- English is the most dominant language on the web, but on a global level, it’s not that widely spoken or understood. India has 22 official languages with over a million speakers each, and one quarter of the Indian population is non-literate. For people with disabilities, the literacy rate is even lower. When these users open your app, they may rely on symbols and pictures, potentially with accessibility aids, to perform tasks. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1403756165/16099816))
- Use simple, basic English and avoid jargon.
  Translate to languages your users are most comfortable with for reading. Test various languages and text flows in your app’s interface. For example, Arabic takes more vertical space and is rendered right to left.
  Keep your sentences short and provide graphical cues to guide non-literate users and people with cognitive disabilities. Combining text with images--such as a written menu with clear icons--enables easier and faster access across all literacy levels.
  Avoid complex hierarchical structures, such as menus, tabs, or drop downs, as users are more likely to get lost; plus, those who access your app with a screen reader might need a long time to find what they are looking for.
  Minimize the need to type or text search. Whenever possible, allow voice input, autocomplete text fields, and present browseable interfaces. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1403756165/16099858))
