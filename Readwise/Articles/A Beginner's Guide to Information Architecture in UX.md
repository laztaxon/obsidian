## Highlights
- 8 Principles Of Information Architecture ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285574/16824421))
- These principles are based on the understanding that the architect’s focus should be purely the structure – something that can be shown with maps and flowcharts.
  To do this, the architect should get a good understanding of the functionality of the site, and they should also have a complete inventory of the content. Once these requirements are met, the information architect can begin optimizing the IA using these 8 principles:
  The principle of objects: Content should be treated as a living, breathing thing. It has lifecycles, behaviors, and attributes.
  The principle of choices: Less is more. Keep the number of choices to a minimum.
  The principle of disclosure:Show a preview of information that will help users understand what kind of information is hidden if they dig deeper.
  The principle of exemplars: Show examples of content when describing the content of the categories.
  The principle of front doors: Assume that at least 50% of users will use a different entry point than the home page.
  The principle of multiple classifications: Offer users several different classification schemes to browse the site’s content.
  The principle of focused navigation: Keep navigation simple and never mix different things.
  The principle of growth: Assume that the content on the website will grow. Make sure the website is scalable. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285574/16824426))

- The Value For The User ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285574/16824428))
- Known-item seeking: Users will come to the website to search for something desirable and known.
  Exploratory seeking: Users will come to the website looking for inspiration. They’re looking for something desirable but not sure what exactly.
  Exhaustive research: Users are in a process of an extensive research. They want to find as much information as possible.
  Re-finding:A user needs a desired items again and are trying to find it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285574/16824436))

- Define content
  If a website already has content, go through that first and decide what to keep and what to get rid of. If the website is new, start from scratch. You need to have a clear understanding of the content.
  When your website already has content you can do one of the following:
  Full inventory
  Write down everything that you have on the site. This might take a long time and perhaps even a team of people, but it’s the most useful. When you decide for this option include all pages, all downloadable content, and also any media or interactive content.
  Partial inventory
  A partial inventory is still better than nothing. Focus on the important parts and higher levels.
  Content audit
  This approach gives us the least information, but it’s quicker and simpler. We focus on determining how useful, accurate, and overall how effective the content is. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1425285574/16824451))
