- Summary: When working with trauma survivors, it is common for clients to dissociate, or mentally check out, during sessions. This dissociation is a coping strategy developed in childhood to escape potentially threatening situations. It is important for therapists to address and identify dissociative experiences in order to help clients understand and consciously choose to stay present. Dissociation always occurs because the client feels threatened, even if there is no objective danger. Therapists can help by identifying triggers and working with clients to process and understand the origins of their dissociative responses.

- if the client feels the need to mentally escape, it means they are feeling unsafe. Therefore, identifying and understanding the catalysts, as well as knowing how to intervene and re-ground the client, helps to restore a sense of safety during the session and within the [therapeutic relationship](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapeutic-alliance). Since dissociation is not an arbitrary response, it always helps to put the dissociative reaction in context.
