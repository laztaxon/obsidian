- Summary: Grounding techniques are strategies that can help individuals manage traumatic memories or strong emotions. They aim to allow a person to step away from negative thoughts or flashbacks by focusing on the present environment. Different experts suggest various grounding techniques, such as breathing exercises and sensory diffusers. One approach involves placing the feet firmly on the ground, stating the date and time, and observing the present surroundings. The five senses, including sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell, can also be utilized in grounding techniques. While grounding techniques may work for some, it is important for individuals to seek medical attention and explore the most effective treatment plan for their mental health condition.

## Highlights
- The purpose of grounding techniques is to allow a person to step away from negative thoughts or flashbacks. Techniques such as these can decrease the intensity of a person’s feelings or trauma by distracting them using the five senses.

- To follow this grounding technique, a person should:
  1. Place the feet firmly on the ground.
  2. State the date and time.
  3. Take slow, deep breaths.
  4. State what they can observe in their present environment.
  5. Remind themselves that they are in a safe place right now.
  6. Observe their immediate surroundings and describe items in the room or environment.
  To decrease the intensity of their feelings, a person can use visualization exercises or sensory diffusers. Some techniques include:
  • visualizing turning down an emotional dial
  • clenching their fist to hold on to the feelings, then letting them go when they release their fist
  • visualizing a safe place through guided imagery
  • distracting themselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdb2gc7pkxbbbj9yhsrfmy31))
- Achieving distraction from memories of the past may include trying different strategies. Some examples include:
  • focusing on recent or future events, such as a to-do list for the day
  • reminding oneself of their current safety
  • touching a chair or wiggling the toes to remind oneself of the current reality
  • counting or reciting something to return focus to the present ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdb2hamvewe2y7y30ttv6nf9))
- The five senses
  When practicing grounding techniques, people can focus on the five senses: sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell.
  One useful grounding technique reported by people with [bipolar disorder](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/37010) is the [5-4-3-2-1 technique](https://ibpf.org/articles/9-tips-to-help-you-get-through-a-panic-attack/). Some people suggest that this technique can help them through a [panic attack](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8872).
  The technique uses the five senses. A person should:
  • search for five things they can see
  • search for four things they can touch
  • search for three things they can hear
  • search for two things they can smell
  • search for one thing they can taste
  • smelling food or flowers
  • holding an object, such as a rock or a leaf, in the hands
  • listening to music or the noise of traffic outside
  Some people may prefer practicing grounding techniques outside, since there is more to see, hear, touch, and smell outdoors. There is also more freedom to move around than indoors ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdb2j94jmengjng3b32zmp2y))
- Some experts call grounding techniques “earthing.” Earthing, like grounding techniques, can help bring the body and mind back into contact with the earth.
  One study in the journal *[Psychological ReportsTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25748085)* assessed whether or not earthing could affect mood.
  The researchers worked with 40 participants who were either grounded or ungrounded. All participants sat in a comfortable recliner chair for 1 hour.
  The grounded participants had a conductive pillow, mat, and patches to connect them to the earth. In the ungrounded group, the participants were not connected to the earth.
  In this small study, the researchers observed that the grounded participants experienced an improvement in their mood compared with the ungrounded participants. However, further research is required to confirm the effectiveness of earthing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdb2qmgkm5vtb3s0bsk8hnd7))
