   What are the four types of variables supported in Figma? 
   The four types of variables supported in Figma are color, number, boolean, and string types.
   What is the purpose of variable groups in Figma?
   Variable groups allow for further grouping of variables and hold larger sets of variables, making it easier to manage and organize them.
   What is the difference between styles and variables in Figma?
   Styles are great when referencing multiple values at once, whereas variables only support one raw value. While variables offer several advantages, such as their ability to align more directly to code and to offer more straightforward methods of organization, styles still have their purpose.

## Highlights
- The launch of components allowed designers to create and maintain reusable assets, such as buttons, inputs, and controls, often matching those building blocks in code with Figma. Styles let us more concretely define color, typography, and effects within designs so that these more primitive elements could be made consistent and accessible across platforms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbre3c4erjqj40t7ywvvgvrz))
- Variables allow us to create, store, and use reusable values throughout Figma, such as text strings or colors. A number can be created and used to represent a system‚Äôs corner radius value or a color always intended for use as a button‚Äôs background color can be defined and referenced. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbre4twn0vdh0bq42v0ewjr3))
- Within Figma today, four types of variables are supported: `color`, `number`, `boolean`, and `string` types. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbre64347d0n9nze9qe574gw))
- Applying number variable types to a design is done directly from the input field, where the control is located. A variable icon will be on the right of the input within any field that allows variables to be used. Selecting this icon shows a list of all supported variables, and the desired variable can be selected by directly clicking or using the up/down arrow keys.

  With a variable applied, the calculated value that the variable equates to is shown (in this case, it‚Äôs 4px) and appears as a new gray container within the input. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrefm0j7nmefdfdxr6jzzs4))
- To apply a boolean variable to control a layer‚Äôs visibility, first, select the layer and **right-click** the visible/hidden toggle from the right sidebar. Each available boolean variable is shown and can then be applied to the selected layer.
  ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*3bzmO5qKnERM8F7D.png)
  As far as I know, this is the only feature within the design panel that is based on a right-click interaction to access and use. Because of that, I found that it does take a little extra effort and practice to remember, but becomes natural pretty quickly.
  To bind a boolean variable to an instance‚Äôs variant properties, hover next to the variant control, and locate the familiar variable icon. From here, each available boolean variable appears. And again, at least at the moment, this ability to bind a variable to a variant control is only available for an instance of a component, not yet for the main component. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbreh8z1r54jyqemyw75vwef))
- String variables can be applied to text layers. With a text layer selected, the variable icon appears within the Text section of the design panel, and from here, it‚Äôs possible to choose either a string or a number variable, which is so handy, as we may want to use number variables directly within a design. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrehvv6srmp0wqgvsd89prv))
- Aliasing, which refers to linking one variable‚Äôs definition to another already existing variable, is also supported! This process allows for the implementation of design tokens and creates a more efficient process when making or managing updates, as dozens of aliased items can refer back to a single variable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrej7exbxmb22n5gm0tb524))
- imagine creating variables for your core set of colors, including blues, greens, reds, and yellows. These color values may be defined as a scaling series, such as `yellow100` or `blue400`, and once defined within a collection, you can create new variables that *refer* to those global colors. For instance, a variable called `primary-button-bg` can reference `blue400`, and so can another variable, such as `primary-control-bg`. This new linkage means that if the brand ever changes and the core colors are adjusted, only the initial set of global colors needs to be changed, and their color changes will propagate downwards to the variables that reference them, such as `primary-button-bg` and `primary-control-bg`. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrejv62tk22m4017pk2jqb6))
- To create an alias for a variable, right-click on an already defined variable‚Äôs value and choose ‚ÄúCreate alias,‚Äù then select the ‚ÄúLibraries‚Äù tab, which shows all compatible variables, ready to reference. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrek994x3vz6c0d0ecdzevm))
- Variable collections refer to specific sets of both variables and modes. We can use them to organize and keep related variables close together, and because collections **allow for different modes to exist**, collections are a critical part of the process for variable creation.
  For example, modes for desktop and mobile breakpoints may exist within a spacing variable collection, whereas within a color variable collection, modes for light and dark themes may exist, and because of this, collections are quite helpful. To create a new collection, select the dropdown at the top left of the Variables modal, and choose ‚Äúcreate collection.‚Äù
  üí° **Tip:** If there‚Äôs an entire collection of variables you would prefer to keep private when publishing, place either a period or an underscore at the start of the collection‚Äôs name, similar to components. This feature can be helpful for global sets of colors or, like in the above example, sets of number scales, which may not be for use within production-ready designs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrem6texgs070w319ghfqvx))
    - Note: Variable collections are like little folders that hold sets of variables and modes. They help us keep related variables organized and close together. Modes are like different versions of a variable that can be used for things like different screen sizes or light/dark themes. We can create new collections by clicking on a dropdown menu in the Variables section and selecting "create collection." If we want to keep a collection private, we can put a period or underscore at the beginning of its name.
- Variable groups allow for even further grouping of variables. I‚Äôve started to think of variable groups as little folders that can hold larger sets of variables. If, in your system, you have dozens of color variables that apply to all buttons or all backgrounds, it may make sense to create a larger group that keeps all similar variables close by and easily accessible. Groups can be created by right-clicking on one or multiple variables and selecting ‚Äúnew group with selection.‚Äù ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbremrjc6w6p02xfy3b1k5ge))
- In my own work, I‚Äôm choosing to create groups as often as possible, as they help visually separate the many variables within the system. For aliased colors, I‚Äôve created groups for fills, strokes, text, and icons, and for the global colors, I‚Äôve created groups for each core color, such as blue, red, or green. (Also, am I the only one who finds this view to be so satisfying?)
  üí° **Tip:** When creating a new variable or renaming one that exists, type ‚Äú/‚Äù in the name to create a new group, where the string after the ‚Äú/‚Äù becomes the new group‚Äôs name ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbren56hwya6rbxh0ftgs795))

    - Note: Create groups to visually separate system variables/colors.
      When working on a design, sometimes there are lots of different things that need to be kept organized. One way to do this is by using something called "variable groups," which are like little folders that can hold different sets of variables. For example, you can create groups for different colors, like blue, red, or green. This helps to keep everything organized and easy to find. When you create a new variable or rename an existing one, you can use a special symbol (/) to make a new group with a name of your choice.
- Modes exist within variables, allowing for additional context within a variable collection, such as theming or size specifications.
  For example, within the ‚ÄúSizing‚Äù collection below, I have two number variables: `size-screen-width` and `size-screen-height`, and three modes: `iPhone 14 Pro`, `iPhone 14`, and `iPhone SE`.
  Having these modes available means that I can take a design that uses the width and height variables, and by changing its mode, I can adjust for the device I intend to design for.
  Each *row* is the variable within the Variable modal, with each *column* representing the mode. To create a new mode, tap the ‚Äú+‚Äù towards the right of the modal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrep705asbxyfqc8ayr9vpg))
    - Note: Variables have modes for theming and sizing.
      Variables are like tools that help designers make different versions of a design for different devices. Modes are like different settings within those tools. For example, imagine a tool that lets you change the size of a design. Within that tool, you could have different modes for different devices, like a big phone or a small phone. These modes help you make sure the design looks good on all devices. You can create new modes by tapping a plus sign, and each row in the tool represents a different variable.
- üí° **Tip:** Whenever a mode is needed, but its use doesn‚Äôt apply to other variables in the collection, it‚Äôs a sign that a new collection may be necessary. That said, it‚Äôs not possible to move a variable from one collection to another, at least at the time of writing, so planning here will ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbreph54p18zw0m81r0dq0we))
- Let‚Äôs imagine that a design supports `light` mode and the `iPhone 14 Pro` mode via applied variables, just like in the example above. If we‚Äôd like to switch that entire design to a `dark` theme or adjust its dimensions to support `iPhone 14`, the next step is understanding how to change into that different mode.
  First, make sure that the selected item uses a variable to adjust the mode in use. If no variable is applied, Figma won‚Äôt show the option to switch modes. With the design selected, head over to the right panel, and within the Layer section (or within the Page section if intending to adjust the mode for the entire page), there‚Äôs a new icon that resembles two variable icons stacked on top of one another. Clicking this reveals all of the different modes available to switch into, all based only on the variables in use. If the selected item does not yet use a variable from the ‚ÄúSizing‚Äù collection, those available modes won‚Äôt be shown.
  Mode switching is available for layers, frames, components and component sets, sections, groups, and finally, entire pages, too!
  ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*zirpqUcLQuIlTZU1.png)
  üí° **Tip:** Selecting Auto means that all objects nested inside take on the modes of their parent container, and if no specific mode is set, all objects then fall back to the default mode, shown in parentheses. The mode that‚Äôs set to Auto is based on the first (or left-most) mode created within the collection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbrepwp2hmy8b27ae9asbtd1))

    - Note: Switching themes or dimensions in Figma designs.
      Sometimes we want to change the way a design looks on different devices or in different lighting. To do this, we can use something called "modes" in Figma. We can switch the mode of a design by using variables that control its size and other properties. If we want to switch to a different mode, we need to make sure that our design is using those variables first. We can then click on an icon in the right panel to see all the available modes based on the variables we're using. If we're not using any of the variables needed for a particular mode, we won't be able to switch to that mode. We can use this mode switching feature for layers, frames, components, groups, and even entire pages.
- Scoping
  When creating variables for various files and component libraries, it‚Äôs helpful to think about how and where those variables should or shouldn‚Äôt be used ‚Äî not to over-restrict, but instead as a way **to improve the experience designers have when using the system**.
  Ideally, number variable types created to represent spacing and padding values should only be available for selection with those specific fields and not used within inputs such as corner radius. Similarly, color variable types that define fill or stroke options shouldn‚Äôt be surfaced when selecting a text layer‚Äôs color. This way of thinking within Figma is called ‚Äúscoping,‚Äù a feature available for all variable types!
  ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*3dfW_KLZji6i4lzw.png)
  To access scoping, tap the configure icon at the end of a variable‚Äôs row. This button launches the Edit variable modal, which can further define a variable‚Äôs use and the feature to limit its scope. In the example above, I can limit the `color-label-primary` color variable to only be used for text and not within frames, shapes, or strokes. **Note:** Figma has noted that it‚Äôs possible to apply these selections to color variables at the time of writing, but scoping won‚Äôt yet take effect‚Äîbut the complete feature should be coming soon!

    - Note: "Scoping" improves designers' experience by restricting variable use.
      Variables are a way to create and use reusable values, like colors or text. There are four types of variables in Figma: color, number, boolean, and string. Scoping is a way to control where and how variables can be used. This helps designers have a better experience when using the system. For example, a color variable used for fill or stroke options shouldn't be available when selecting a text layer's color. To access scoping, you can tap the configure icon at the end of a variable's row. This way, you can limit where a variable can be used, like only for text and not shapes or strokes.
- Styles vs. Variables
  Perhaps the most frequent question designers are asking with the launch of variables is, ‚ÄúWith variables, should I ever use styles again?‚Äù and right now, I believe that answer still is ‚Äúyes‚Äù!
  Within Figma, styles are still great when referencing multiple values at once, not a single value, as variables only support one raw value. Unlike variables, styles also support the organization of both gradients and effects. So, while variables bring several advantages, such as their ability to align more directly to code and to offer more straightforward methods of organization, styles still have their purpose ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hceedzrjk1ae9mmyzds4z906))
    - Note: Use styles with multiple values, not variables alone.
