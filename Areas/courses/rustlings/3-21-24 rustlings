It's the first time in a minute that I am going back to try rustlings. It's been probably like a month of two and I do feel like I have some more experience understand and writing code.
But, I feel unsure if rust is the right language to be learning. I figured it might give me a strong basis for other programming, but I might be bitting off more than I can chew.

#### vecs1.rs
create a vec holding the same elements as array a
[[rust-vectors]]
- [ ] solution
```rust
fn array_and_vec() -> ([i32; 4], Vec<i32>) {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40]; // a plain array
    let v = vec![10, 20, 30, 40]; // TODO: declare your vector here with the macro for vectors
    (a, v)
}
```
